Fundada en 1997 y con sede en Isernhagen, Alemania, VetZ ha creado soluciones de software potentes, fáciles de usar y totalmente integradas para mejorar el flujo de trabajo, la comunicación, el servicio y los resultados de los pacientes. A lo largo de los últimos 25 años, VetZ se ha consolidado como la solución de software de gestión de la información de la consulta de referencia en las principales instituciones sanitarias veterinarias. En la actualidad, VetZ cuenta con más de 70 empleados y más de 3.300 consultas veterinarias, algunas de las más grandes de Europa y del mundo, como clientes. Las soluciones de VetZ potencian y conectan el ciclo completo de la atención sanitaria de las mascotas, desde las comunicaciones con la familia, el alojamiento y la programación hasta los diagnósticos (imágenes, puntos de atención, laboratorio de referencia), los gráficos, los registros de salud, la telemedicina, el comercio electrónico, la facturación, el inventario, el cumplimiento, los análisis y mucho más. ""Estamos muy contentos de dar la bienvenida al maravilloso liderazgo, gente y cultura de VetZ a la familia global de Heska. Conozco y admiro a VetZ y a sus fundadores desde 2009 y desde entonces he querido hacer realidad esta asociación. En mis décadas en este espacio, no he visto otro PIMS tan potente; VetZ representa la cúspide de la lógica empresarial y la capacidad en la asistencia sanitaria veterinaria"", comentó el consejero delegado y presidente de Heska, <span class=""xn-person"">Kevin Wilson</span>. ""Hoy, Heska entra en el mercado de los PIMS como líder, con una posición especialmente fuerte en nuestro principal mercado europeo, Alemania. Intentaremos incorporar inmediatamente VetZ PIMS a nuestras ofertas de suscripción para nuestra creciente base global de más de 7.000 clientes"", continuó Wilson. ""Con VetZ PIMS, Heska se convierte en una de las razas más raras: un equipo unificado que ofrece las mejores soluciones y suscripciones totalmente integradas para el diagnóstico en el punto de atención, el diagnóstico rápido, el diagnóstico por imagen, los servicios especializados de telemedicina y las ofertas de laboratorio de referencia. Se trata de otro hito importante cumplido en nuestro plan estratégico. Ahora, ampliaremos nuestras capacidades para seguir ofreciendo experiencias, valor y resultados excelentes a más veterinarios, socios conectados, mascotas y familias de mascotas de todo el mundo. <span class=""xn-person"">Ingo Fraedrich</span>, cofundador y director general de VetZ, comentó: ""Estamos encantados de unirnos a la familia Heska. Estoy increíblemente orgulloso del sólido negocio que nuestro equipo de VetZ ha construido durante casi 25 años. Nos hemos asociado con nuestros amigos veterinarios y socios de toda Europa para mejorar el bienestar de las mascotas y optimizar las prácticas veterinarias con un impacto duradero. Con este emocionante nuevo capítulo, nos expandiremos aún más rápido. Heska es el socio ideal para aprovechar las soluciones existentes de VetZ, de categoría mundial, en nuevas zonas geográficas. Nuestro <i>easyVet</i> es una solución de gestión de consultas y PACS (software de archivo de imágenes y comunicaciones) líder en Alemania y en mercados clave de Europa. Nuestro <i>vetsXL </i>es la mayor plataforma business-to-business para empresas veterinarias en Alemania, con más de 10.000 consultas participantes y socios del sector. Y <i>petsXL</i>, nuestra aplicación y portal de salud animal de nueva generación para propietarios de mascotas, se está ampliando a un ritmo notable para conectar a decenas de miles de miembros de la familia de mascotas con sus proveedores y registros. En conjunto, estas plataformas y servicios asociados hacen de las soluciones de VetZ la plataforma más completa del mercado"". El otro cofundador y director general de VetZ, <span class=""xn-person"">Thomas Fraedrich</span>, añadió: ""Yo y todo el equipo de VetZ estamos entusiasmados de unirnos a la familia Heska y mi hermano y yo estamos entusiasmados de unirnos al gran equipo de liderazgo de Heska - los conocemos desde hace muchos años y esperamos trabajar aún más estrechamente juntos para escalar e invertir más para expandir el acceso del mundo a nuestras poderosas soluciones que mejoran el flujo de trabajo, y las capacidades de comunicación y ofrecer interacciones de atención médica veterinaria más eficientes, más acceso a la atención, y mejores resultados de salud y financieros.""

(Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""#financial-modal"">NVAX</a>), uma empresa de biotecnologia dedicada ao desenvolvimento e comercialização de vacinas de última geração para doenças infecciosas graves, e o Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. (SII), o maior fabricante de vacinas do mundo por volume, anunciaram&nbsp;hoje que a Agência Nacional de Controle de Medicamentos e Alimentos da República da Indonésia, ou Badan Peng was Obat dan Makanan (Badan POM), concedeu autorização de uso emergencial (AUE) para a vacina de nanopartícula recombinante contra a COVID-19 à base proteína com o adjuvante Matrix-M™ da Novavax. Ela será fabricada pelo SII na Índia e comercializada pelo SII na Indonésia sob o nome de marca COVOVAX™. ""A primeira autorização da vacina contra a COVID-19 da Novavax exemplifica nosso compromisso com o acesso global equitativo e atenderá a uma necessidade vital para a Indonésia, que, embora seja o quarto país mais populoso do mundo, continua tentando obter vacinas suficientes para sua população"", disse <span class=""xn-person"">Stanley C. Erck</span>, presidente e CEO da Novavax. ""Isso também marca a primeira autorização regulatória do mundo de uma vacina contra a COVID-19 baseada em proteína com base em dados clínicos de Fase 3 que demonstram eficácia e um perfil de segurança favorável. Esse é um momento marcante para a Novavax e para nosso parceiro, o Serum Institute of <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>, e é a primeira de muitas autorizações que a Novavax espera para nossa vacina em todo o mundo nas próximas semanas e meses."" Como a vacina é armazenada em temperaturas de 2° a 8°&nbsp;Celsius, é possível utilizar os canais de fornecimento de vacinas existentes com recursos de cadeia de frio mais tradicionais, aumentando potencialmente o acesso em áreas de difícil acesso e as taxas de vacinação em todo o país. Espera-se que as remessas iniciais para a Indonésia comecem imediatamente. ""O acesso ao fornecimento de uma vacina segura e altamente eficaz, juntamente com sua facilidade de distribuição, deve ser um facilitador essencial para ajudar a Indonésia a controlar o atual surto do coronavírus"", disse Adar Poonawalla, CEO do Serum Institute of <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>. ""Continuamos a trabalhar com urgência para garantir que a primeira opção de vacina contra a COVID-19 baseada em proteína da Indonésia esteja disponível para todos que estão aguardando sua chegada."" A Novavax e o SII já solicitaram autorização para a vacina contra a COVID-19 da Novavax na Índia e nas Filipinas, bem como para a lista de uso emergencial (LUE) da Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS). Recentemente, a Novavax também concluiu as solicitações que estavam em andamento para autorização da vacina da Novavax perante as agências reguladoras no Reino Unido, União Europeia, Canadá e Austrália.

Essas informações serão publicadas nos próximos dias. <b>O uso autorizado da vacina contra a Covid-19 da Novavax na Indonésia<br class=""dnr""></b>A Badan POM emitiu autorização de uso emergencial (AUE) para a Covovax/ proteína spike recombinante do vírus SARS-CoV-2 5 mcg para induzir a imunidade contra o SARS-CoV-2 e prevenir a COVID-19 em adultos com 18 anos ou mais. <b>Informações importantes de segurança<br class=""dnr""></b>A COVOVAX é contra-indicada para pessoas com hipersensibilidade à substância ativa ou a qualquer um dos excipientes dessa vacina.  <b>Sobre os estudos de Fase 3 da NVX-CoV2373<br class=""dnr""></b>A NVX-CoV2373 está sendo avaliada em dois importantes estudos de Fase 3: o estudo PREVENT-19 nos&nbsp;EUA&nbsp;e no&nbsp;México,&nbsp;que demonstrou 100% de proteção contra a forma moderada e grave da doença e 90,4% de eficácia em geral. Em geral, ela foi bem tolerada e desencadeou resposta de anticorpos significativa. A vacina também está sendo avaliada em um estudo no&nbsp;Reino Unido,&nbsp;que demonstrou eficácia de 96,4% contra a cepa original do vírus, 86,3% contra a variante Alpha (B.1.1.7) e 89,7% de eficácia em geral.  A NVX-CoV2373, a vacina contra a Covid-19 da Novavax, é uma candidata a vacina à base de proteína desenvolvida a partir da sequência genética da primeira cepa do SARS-CoV-2, o vírus causador da COVID-19. A NVX-CoV2373 foi criada utilizando-se a tecnologia de nanopartícula recombinante da Novavax para gerar um antígeno derivado da proteína spike (S) do coronavírus e é formulada com o adjuvante à base de saponina patenteado da Novavax, o Matrix-M™, para melhorar a resposta imunológica e estimular altos níveis de anticorpos neutralizantes. A NVX-CoV2373 contém antígeno de proteína purificado e não pode ser replicado, nem pode causar a COVID-19. A vacina contra a COVID-19 da Novavax é embalada como uma formulação líquida pronta para uso em um frasco contendo dez doses. O regime de vacinação exige duas doses de 0,5 ml (5 microgramas de antígeno e 50 microgramas do adjuvante Matrix-M), administradas por via intramuscular com 21 dias de intervalo. A vacina deve ser armazenada em temperaturas entre&nbsp;2 °C e 8 °C, permitindo o uso dos canais de fornecimento de vacinas e da cadeia de frio existentes. <b>Sobre o adjuvante Matrix-M™</b>&nbsp;<br class=""dnr"">O adjuvante patenteado da Novavax à base de saponina, Matrix-M™, demonstrou um efeito potente e bem tolerado ao estimular a entrada de células apresentadoras do antígeno no local da injeção e melhorar a apresentação do antígeno em linfonodos locais, aumentando a resposta imunológica. <b>Sobre a Novavax<br class=""dnr""></b>A Novavax, Inc.&nbsp;(Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""#financial-modal"">NVAX</a>) é uma empresa de biotecnologia que promove a melhoria da saúde em todo o mundo por meio da descoberta, do desenvolvimento e da comercialização de vacinas inovadoras para prevenir doenças infecciosas graves.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 22:22 ET Share this article PEQUIM, 2 de novembro de 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- A 26ª Conferência das Nações Unidas sobre Mudanças Climáticas <span class=""xn-money"">(COP26)</span> foi aberta no domingo em <span class=""xn-location"">Glasgow</span>, na Escócia, a primeira conferência após o ciclo de avaliação de cinco anos sob o Acordo de <span class=""xn-location"">Paris</span> firmado em 2015. Em muitas ocasiões, o presidente chinês Xi Jinping destacou a visão da <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> sobre o enfrentamento do desafio climático, expressou o apoio firme da <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> ao Acordo de <span class=""xn-location"">Paris</span> e anunciou as ações concretas do país para proteger o planeta. Em sua declaração por escrito ao World Leaders Summit na <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span>, publicada na segunda-feira, Xi reiterou um apelo por unidade global e ações para abordar as mudanças climáticas e apresentou três sugestões. <b>Promover o consenso multilateral</b>  ""Quando se trata de desafios globais, como as mudanças climáticas, o multilateralismo é a prescrição certa"", disse Xi na declaração, conclamando todas as partes a desenvolver o consenso existente, aumentar a confiança mútua e intensificar a cooperação para que a <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span> seja bem-sucedida. O presidente chinês contribuiu para o grande progresso nas questões climáticas em nível global. Em 2015, Xi fez um discurso na Conferência de <span class=""xn-location"">Paris</span> sobre Mudanças Climáticas, fazendo uma contribuição histórica para a conclusão do Acordo de <span class=""xn-location"">Paris</span>. Na cúpula Climate Ambition em dezembro de 2020, o presidente Xi anunciou os compromissos adicionais da <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> para 2030, fazendo progressos constantes na implementação do Acordo de <span class=""xn-location"">Paris</span>. No início deste mês, ele destacou a importância de compartilhar os frutos do desenvolvimento verde entre todos os países ao se dirigir à cúpula dos líderes da 15ª reunião da Conferência das Partes para a Convenção de Diversidade Biológica <span class=""xn-money"">(COP15)</span>, organizada pela <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. <b>Foco em ação concreta</b>  ""As visões se tornarão realidade apenas quando agirmos de acordo com elas"", disse Xi na segunda-feira, ao incentivar todos os países a honrar seus compromissos, estabelecer metas realistas e fazer o seu melhor de acordo com as condições nacionais para cumprir suas medidas de ação climática. Como o presidente chinês disse, a <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> sempre honra suas palavras com ações. De acordo com um relatório sobre mudanças climáticas divulgado na semana passada, a intensidade de emissões de carbono do país em 2020 caiu 48,8% em comparação com 2005 e 18,8% no nível de 2015, mostrando que a <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> leva o Acordo de <span class=""xn-location"">Paris</span> a sério. Até o final de 2020, os combustíveis não fósseis respondiam por 16% do consumo de energia primária na <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> e o país também retirou gradualmente, durante a última década, 120 milhões de quilowatts de capacidade instalada de geração de energia a carvão. A <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> lançou iniciativas de ações ecológicas que incentivam a infraestrutura, a energia, o transporte e o financiamento verdes sob a estrutura da iniciativa Cinturão e Rota (BRI). Em 2020, 57% do investimento da <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> em países parceiros da BRI foi para projetos de energia renovável, um aumento de 38% em 2019. <b>Acelerando a transição ecológica</b>  Na segunda-feira, Xi destacou o papel da inovação em ciência e tecnologia e pediu a promoção de uma economia e sociedade mais verdes e a exploração de um novo caminho que coordene o desenvolvimento com conservação. Recentemente, a <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> publicou duas diretrizes importantes: um documento de um projeto de alto nível para atingir o pico das emissões de carbono e alcançar a neutralidade de carbono, e um plano de ação para atingir o pico das emissões de carbono antes de 2030. De acordo com Xi, o país lançará ainda planos específicos de implementação para áreas-chave, como energia, indústria, construção e transporte; e para setores-chave, como carvão, eletricidade, ferro e aço, cimento, juntamente com medidas de apoio em termos de ciência e tecnologia, sequestro de carbono, tributação e incentivos financeiros. Esses planos juntos formarão a estrutura política ""1+N"" da <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> para ajudar o país a cumprir seu compromisso de atingir o pico de suas emissões de CO2 antes de 2030 e alcançar a neutralidade de carbono antes de 2060 com um cronograma, roteiro e plano claramente definidos. <a href=""https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-11-02/From-COP15-to-COP26-China-calls-for-unite-actions-to-protect-Earth-14R8MSzM208/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-11-02/From-COP15-to-COP26-China-calls-for-unite-actions-to-protect-Earth-14R8MSzM208/index.html</a>  FONTE CGTN  <a title=""Link to http://www.cgtn.com"" href=""http://www.cgtn.com/"" class=""linkOnClick"" data-include="""" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cgtn.com</a><br>  SOURCE CGTN More news releases in similar topics <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 22:20 ET Share this article PEKÍN, 2 de noviembre de 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- El pasado domingo se inauguró en <span class=""xn-location"">Glasgow</span>, Escocia, la 26.ª Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático <span class=""xn-money"">(COP26)</span>. Se trata de la primera conferencia después del ciclo de revisión quinquenal en virtud del Acuerdo de París celebrado en 2015. El presidente chino, Xi Jinping, ha destacado el punto de vista de <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> sobre cómo abordar el desafío climático en numerosas ocasiones, ha expresado el firme apoyo de <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> al Acuerdo de París y ha anunciado las acciones concretas del país para proteger el planeta. En su declaración escrita ante la Cumbre de líderes mundiales en la <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span>, publicada el lunes, Xi reiteró un llamamiento a la unidad y acciones globales para abordar el cambio climático y presentó tres propuestas. <b>Mantener el consenso multilateral</b>  ""Cuando se trata de desafíos globales como el cambio climático, la multilateralidad es la receta correcta"", afirmó Xi en su declaración, y exhortó a todas las partes a que aprovechen el consenso existente, aumenten la confianza mutua e intensifiquen la cooperación para que la <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span> sea un éxito. El presidente chino ha promovido importantes avances en cuestiones climáticas a nivel mundial. En 2015, Xi pronunció un discurso de apertura en la Conferencia de París sobre el Cambio Climático, en el que hizo un histórico aporte a la conclusión del Acuerdo de París. En la Cumbre sobre la Ambición Climática de diciembre de 2020, el mandatario anunció los nuevos compromisos de <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> para 2030, lo que constituirá un firme progreso en la implementación del Acuerdo de París. A principios de este mes, subrayó la importancia de compartir los frutos del desarrollo ecológico entre todos los países al dirigirse a la Cumbre de líderes de la 15.ª reunión de la Conferencia de los Miembros del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica <span class=""xn-money"">(COP15)</span>, organizada por <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. <b>Centrarse en acciones concretas</b>  ""Las visiones solo se harán realidad cuando actuemos sobre ellas"", señaló Xi el lunes, cuando instó a todos los países a cumplir su compromiso, establecer objetivos realistas y hacer todo lo posible de acuerdo con las condiciones nacionales para cumplir sus medidas de acción climática. Como sostuvo el jefe de Estado, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> siempre cumple sus palabras con hechos. Según un informe técnico sobre el cambio climático publicado la semana pasada, la intensidad de las emisiones de carbono del país en 2020 se redujo en un 48,8&nbsp;% en comparación con 2005 y en un 18,8&nbsp;% respecto al nivel de 2015, lo que demuestra que <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> toma en serio el Acuerdo de París. A finales de 2020, los combustibles no fósiles representaron el 16&nbsp;% del consumo de energía primaria en <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, y el país también eliminó 120 millones de kilovatios de capacidad de generación de energía instalada a carbón durante la última década. <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> ha puesto en marcha iniciativas de acción ecológica que fomentan la infraestructura, la energía, el transporte y las finanzas ecológicas en el marco de la iniciativa de la Franja y la Ruta (BRI). En 2020, el 57&nbsp;% de la inversión de <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> en los países socios de la iniciativa BRI se destinó a proyectos de energía renovable, en comparación con el 38&nbsp;% en 2019. <b>Acelerar la transición ecológica</b>  El lunes, Xi destacó el papel de la innovación en la ciencia y la tecnología, y llamó a promover una economía y una sociedad más ecológicas y a explorar una nueva vía que articule el desarrollo con la conservación. <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> ha publicado recientemente dos directivas clave: un documento de diseño de primer nivel para alcanzar el máximo de emisiones de carbono y lograr la neutralidad de carbono, y un plan de acción para alcanzar el máximo de emisiones de carbono antes de 2030. De acuerdo con Xi, el país seguirá desarrollando planes de implementación específicos para áreas clave como la energía, la industria, la construcción y el transporte, y para sectores clave como el carbón, la electricidad, el hierro y el acero, y el cemento, junto con medidas de apoyo en términos de ciencia y tecnología, absorción de carbono, fiscalidad e impuestos, e incentivos financieros. El conjunto de estos planes formará el marco político ""1+N"" de <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> para ayudar a la nación a cumplir su promesa de alcanzar el máximo de emisiones de CO2 antes de 2030 y lograr la neutralidad de carbono antes de 2060 con un calendario, una hoja de ruta y un plan claramente definidos. <a href=""https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-11-02/From-COP15-to-COP26-China-calls-for-unite-actions-to-protect-Earth-14R8MSzM208/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-11-02/From-COP15-to-COP26-China-calls-for-unite-actions-to-protect-Earth-14R8MSzM208/index.html</a>  FUENTE CGTN  <a title=""Link to http://www.cgtn.com"" href=""http://www.cgtn.com/"" class=""linkOnClick"" data-include="""" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cgtn.com</a><br>  SOURCE CGTN More news releases in similar topics <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 22:18 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">BEIJING</span>, 3&nbsp;novembre&nbsp;2021 /PRNewswire/ -- La 26<sup>e</sup>&nbsp;Conférence des Parties des Nations Unies sur le changement climatique <span class=""xn-money"">(COP26)</span> s'est ouverte dimanche à <span class=""xn-location"">Glasgow</span>, en Écosse. Il s'agit de la première conférence après le cycle d'examen quinquennal prévu par l'Accord de <span class=""xn-location"">Paris</span> en 2015. Le président de la Chine, Xi&nbsp;Jinping, a à maintes reprises souligné le point de vue de la Chine sur la lutte contre le changement climatique, exprimé le ferme appui de la Chine à l'Accord de <span class=""xn-location"">Paris</span> et annoncé les mesures concrètes prises par le pays pour protéger la planète. Dans sa déclaration écrite au Sommet des dirigeants mondiaux à la <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span>, publiée lundi, M.&nbsp;Xi a réitéré son appel à l'unité mondiale et à des mesures pour lutter contre les changements climatiques et a présenté trois suggestions. <b>Maintenir le consensus multilatéral</b> «&nbsp;En ce qui concerne les défis mondiaux tels que le changement climatique, le multilatéralisme est la bonne solution&nbsp;», a soutenu M.&nbsp;Xi dans la déclaration, encourageant toutes les parties à tirer parti du consensus existant, à accroître la confiance mutuelle et à intensifier la coopération pour réussir la <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span>. Le président chinois a facilité la réalisation de grands progrès sur les questions climatiques à l'échelle mondiale. En&nbsp;2015, il a prononcé un discours-programme lors de la Conférence de <span class=""xn-location"">Paris</span> sur les changements climatiques, apportant une contribution historique à la conclusion de l'Accord de <span class=""xn-location"">Paris</span>. Lors du Sommet sur l'ambition climatique de décembre&nbsp;2020, le président&nbsp;Xi a annoncé les nouveaux engagements de la Chine pour 2030, réalisant des progrès constants dans la mise en œuvre de l'Accord de <span class=""xn-location"">Paris</span>. Plus tôt ce mois-ci, il a souligné l'importance de partager les fruits du développement vert entre tous les pays lorsqu'il s'est adressé au Sommet des dirigeants de la 15<sup>e</sup>&nbsp;réunion de la Conférence des Parties à la Convention sur la diversité biologique <span class=""xn-money"">(COP15)</span>. <b>Mettre l'accent sur des mesures concrètes</b> «&nbsp;Les visions ne se réaliseront que si nous agissons&nbsp;», a déclaré M.&nbsp;Xi lundi en exhortant tous les pays à honorer leur engagement, à fixer des objectifs réalistes et à faire de leur mieux, en fonction des conditions nationales, pour mettre en œuvre leurs mesures de lutte contre les changements climatiques. Comme le président chinois l'a dit, la Chine met toujours un point d'honneur à transformer ses paroles en actes. Selon un livre blanc sur le changement climatique publié la semaine dernière, l'intensité des émissions de carbone du pays en 2020 a diminué de 48,8&nbsp;% par rapport à <span class=""xn-chron"">2005 et</span> de 18,8&nbsp;% par rapport à 2015, ce qui démontre que la Chine prend l'Accord de <span class=""xn-location"">Paris</span> au sérieux. À la fin de 2020, les combustibles non fossiles représentaient 16&nbsp;% de la consommation d'énergie primaire en Chine. Au cours de la dernière décennie, le pays a également éliminé progressivement 120&nbsp;millions de kilowatts de capacité installée de production d'électricité au charbon. La Chine a en outre lancé des initiatives d'action verte qui encouragent les infrastructures, l'énergie, le transport et le financement écologiques dans le cadre de la Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). En 2020, 57&nbsp;% des investissements de la Chine dans les pays partenaires du BRI ont été consacrés à des projets d'énergie renouvelable, contre 38&nbsp;% en 2019. <b>Accélérer la transition verte</b> Lundi, M.&nbsp;Xi a souligné le rôle de l'innovation dans la science et la technologie et a lancé un appel pour la promotion d'une économie et d'une société plus vertes et pour l'exploration d'une nouvelle voie qui concilie le développement et la conservation. La Chine a récemment publié deux directives clés, à savoir un document de conception de haut niveau sur les émissions de carbone maximales et la neutralité carbone, et un plan d'action pour atteindre les émissions de carbone maximales avant 2030. Selon M.&nbsp;Xi, le pays continuera à déployer des plans de mise en œuvre spécifiques dans des domaines essentiels tels que l'énergie, l'industrie, la construction et les transports, et pour des secteurs clés comme le charbon, l'électricité, le fer et l'acier, et le ciment, couplés à des mesures de soutien relatives à la science et à la technologie, aux puits de carbone, à la fiscalité et aux incitatifs financiers. Ensemble, ces plans formeront le cadre stratégique «&nbsp;1+N&nbsp;» de la Chine qui aidera le pays à respecter son engagement de maximiser ses émissions de CO2 avant <span class=""xn-chron"">2030 et</span> d'atteindre la neutralité carbone avant 2060 avec un calendrier, une feuille de route et un plan clairement définis. <a href=""https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-11-02/From-COP15-to-COP26-China-calls-for-unite-actions-to-protect-Earth-14R8MSzM208/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-11-02/From-COP15-to-COP26-China-calls-for-unite-actions-to-protect-Earth-14R8MSzM208/index.html</a>  <a title=""Link to http://www.cgtn.com"" href=""http://www.cgtn.com/"" class=""linkOnClick"" data-include="""" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cgtn.com</a><br>  SOURCE CGTN More news releases in similar topics <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 22:15 ET Share this article  <span class=""legendSpanClass""><span class=""xn-location"">SEOUL</span>, Südkorea</span>, <span class=""legendSpanClass"">3. <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2021</span></span> /PRNewswire/ -- Daewoong Pharmaceutical (Daewoong) (CEO <span class=""xn-person"">Sengho Jeon</span>) hat seine Managementleistung (konsolidiert) im dritten Quartal 2021 bekannt gegeben. Der Umsatz betrug 290,6&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW, was einem Plus von 5&nbsp;% im Jahresvergleich entspricht. Das Betriebsergebnis und der Nettogewinn liegen bei 22,7&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW bzw. 12&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW, was einem Anstieg um fast das Vierfache im Jahresvergleich entspricht. Beim Vergleich der kumulierten Betriebserträge bis zum dritten Quartal verzeichnete Daewoong einen Anstieg von 8,3&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW auf 63,4&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW um das 7,6-fache im Jahresvergleich. Daewoong erzielte in drei aufeinanderfolgenden Quartalen ein Betriebsergebnis von 20&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW und wird dieses Jahr voraussichtlich fast 90&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW erreichen. Im dritten Quartal erreichte der Export von verschreibungspflichtigen Arzneimitteln&nbsp;(ETC) fast 200&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW, was erneut den Status von Daewoong als führendes Unternehmen des ETC-Sektors unter Beweis stellt. Nabota erzielte ebenfalls einen Umsatz von 20&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW. Auch hier wird einem starken Wachstum ausgegangen. Auch rezeptfreie Medikamente&nbsp;(OTC) verzeichneten Erfolge im Bereich gesunder funktioneller Lebensmittel. Basierend auf der Konsolidierung erzielte Daewoong Rekorde von 265,1&nbsp;Milliarden&nbsp;KRW beim Umsatz und 23,9&nbsp;Milliarden&nbsp;KRW beim Betriebsergebnis. Der Umsatz für ETC betrug 174,9&nbsp;Milliarden&nbsp;KRW im dritten Quartal des vorletzten Jahres und 188,9&nbsp;Milliarden&nbsp;KRW im gleichen Quartal des Vorjahres. Der Umsatz im ETC-Bereich stieg im dritten Quartal dieses Jahres erneut um 4,1&nbsp;% und erreichte damit einen Rekordwert von 196,7&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW. Während die insgesamt beachtlichen Umsätze aufrechterhalten wurden, konnten die Produkte von Daewoong mit hoher Rentabilität wie beispielsweise Diabex, Crezet und Luphere, stark ausgebaut werden, wodurch hohe Betriebseinnahmen erzielt wurden. Der kumulierte Umsatz im dritten Quartal stieg im Jahresvergleich um 8&nbsp;%. Der Umsatz von Nabota im dritten Quartal dieses Jahres verdoppelte sich von 11,3&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW auf 20,9&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW. Der Umsatz wies auch weiter den üblichen Wachstumstrend in den großen Vertriebskanälen (d.h. in den <span class=""xn-location"">USA</span> und Korea) auf und erzielte hohe Ergebnisse in Brasilien, <span class=""xn-location"">Thailand</span> und Mexiko. Der kumulierte Umsatz im dritten Quartal stieg im Jahresvergleich um 85,7&nbsp;%. Im OTC-Sektor stieg der Umsatz um 3,3&nbsp;% auf 30&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW gegenüber 29,1&nbsp;Mrd.&nbsp;KRW im dritten Quartal des Vorjahres. Herkömmliche OTC wie Ursa (OTC) und Impactamin verzeichneten konstante Verkaufszahlen, während die Verkäufe von gesunden funktionellen Lebensmitteln gestiegen sind. Daewoong geht davon aus, seine Wachstumsdynamik mit den neuen Medikamenten, die im nächsten Jahr auf den Markt kommen, weiter stärken zu können.&nbsp; Da sich Fexuprazan und Nabota mit ihrem beträchtlichen Betriebswert bewährt haben, werden sie im nächsten Jahr in Korea und in Europa auf den Markt kommen. Die Technologie für Fexuprazan wurde bereits im Wert von 1,1&nbsp;Billionen&nbsp;KRW weltweit exportiert, und Nabota ist das einzige Botulinumtoxin in Asien, das von der US-amerikanischen Food and Drug Administration&nbsp;(FDA) zugelassen wurde. Daher ist geplant, noch in diesem Jahr einen Lizenzantrag für Biologika (BLA) in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> einzureichen. Die klinischen Studien für Behandlungsindikationen in den <span class=""xn-location"">USA</span> verlaufen ebenfalls reibungslos. <span class=""xn-person"">Sengho Jeon</span>, CEO von Daewoong, erklärte: „Kontinuierliche Innovation im Bereich Forschung und Entwicklung, Investitionen und Vertriebsausweitung basierend auf der Vier-Phasen-Strategie der Marketingüberprüfung führen zu Leistungssteigerungen. Wir planen, unsere Wachstumsdynamik weiter zu stärken, indem wir im nächsten Jahr Nabota in Europa und gleichzeitig Fexuprazan in Korea auf den Markt bringen, bei dem die Technologieexporte 1&nbsp;Billion&nbsp;KRW überstiegen haben.""

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 22:07 ET Share this article PEKIN, 3 listopada 2021 r. /PRNewswire/ -- Na początku października, Międzynarodowy Fundusz Walutowy w swoim raporcie dotyczącym światowego wzrostu gospodarczego (World Economic Outlook) obniżył prognozę globalnego wzrostu na rok 2021 do 5,9% i ostrzegł przed znaczną niepewnością ożywienia gospodarczego. Mając to na uwadze, przywódcy 20 największych gospodarek świata zebrali się w sobotę na konferencji w Rzymie, próbując umożliwić ponowne funkcjonowanie wielostronnej platformy - tak jak miało to miejsce, gdy odbywały się dwa szczyty rocznie w bezpośrednim następstwie światowego krachu finansowego w 2008 roku. Chiny, będące znaczącą siłą napędową światowej gospodarki, podkreślały zasadność współpracy, integracji społecznej i ekologicznego rozwoju podczas 16. szczytu przywódców Grupy 20 (G20). <b>Współpraca w walce z pandemią</b> Z uwagi na to, że wirus COVID-19 nadal sieje spustoszenie na świecie, prezydent Chin, Xi Jinping, wygłaszając przemówienie za pośrednictwem transmisji wideo podczas pierwszej sesji szczytu, nadał priorytet międzynarodowej współpracy w zakresie szczepień. Zaproponował on sześciopunktową inicjatywę działania na rzecz globalnej współpracy w zakresie szczepień, skupiającą się na współpracy badawczo-rozwojowej na polu związanym ze szczepionkami, sprawiedliwej ich dystrybucji, zniesieniu praw własności intelektualnej do preparatów przeciwko wirusowi COVID-19, sprawnym handlu szczepionkami, wzajemnym ich uznawaniu oraz wsparciu finansowym dla światowej współpracy w tym zakresie. Według Światowej Organizacji Zdrowia (WHO) nierówności w dystrybucji szczepionek są wyraźne: kraje o niskich dochodach otrzymują mniej niż 0,5 procent ogólnej liczby szczepionek, zaś mniej niż 5 procent mieszkańców Afryki jest w pełni zaszczepionych. WHO wyznaczyła dwa cele w walce z pandemią: zaszczepić, co najmniej 40 procent światowej populacji do końca tego roku i zwiększyć tę liczbę do 70 procent do połowy 2022 roku. „Chiny wyrażają gotowość do współpracy ze wszystkimi stronami, aby zwiększyć dostępność i przystępność cenową szczepionek w krajach rozwijających się i wnieść pozytywny wkład w budowę ogólnoświatowej linii obrony szczepionkowej"" - powiedział prezydent Xi. Do chwili obecnej Chiny dostarczyły ponad 1,6 miliarda dawek szczepionek dla ponad 100 krajów i organizacji międzynarodowych. W sumie w całym roku Chiny dostarczą światu ponad 2 miliardy dawek - dodał, zaznaczając, że kraj ten prowadzi wspólną produkcję szczepionek z 16 państwami. <b>Tworzenie otwartej gospodarki światowej</b> Wspierając ożywienie gospodarcze, prezydent podkreślił, że grupa G20 powinna nadać priorytet rozwojowi w koordynacji polityki makro, wzywając do uczynienia międzynarodowego rozwoju sprawiedliwszym, skuteczniejszym i bardziej sprzyjającym włączeniu społecznemu, by zapewnić, że żaden kraj nie pozostanie w tyle. „Gospodarki rozwinięte powinny wywiązywać się ze swoich zobowiązań dotyczących oficjalnej pomocy rozwojowej i udostępniać więcej środków dla krajów rozwijających się"" - powiedział Xi. Z zadowoleniem przyjął również aktywny udział kolejnych krajów w Światowej Inicjatywie na rzecz Rozwoju. Całkiem niedawno zaproponował on na forum ONZ Światową Inicjatywę na rzecz Rozwoju i wezwał społeczność międzynarodową do zacieśnienia współpracy w takich dziedzinach, jak ograniczanie ubóstwa, bezpieczeństwo żywnościowe, reagowanie na COVID-19 i szczepionki, finansowanie rozwoju, zmiana klimatu i rozwój ekologiczny, industrializacja, gospodarka cyfrowa i łączność. Inicjatywa ta jest ściśle spójna z celem i priorytetem G20, jakim jest promowanie światowego rozwoju, powiedział prezydent Xi. <b>Przestrzeganie zasad rozwoju przyjaznego dla środowiska </b> Przeciwdziałanie zmianom klimatycznym jest jednym z najważniejszych punktów globalnego programu obrad podczas 26. sesji Konferencji Stron <span class=""xn-money"">(COP26)</span> Ramowej Konwencji Narodów Zjednoczonych w sprawie Zmian Klimatu, która rozpocznie się w niedzielę w <span class=""xn-location"">Glasgow</span>, w Szkocji. W tym kontekście, prezydent Xi wezwał kraje rozwinięte do służenia przykładem w zakresie redukcji emisji, podkreślając, że powinny one w pełni uwzględnić szczególne trudności i obawy krajów rozwijających się, wywiązać się ze swoich zobowiązań w zakresie finansowania działań związanych z klimatem oraz zapewnić technologię, budowanie potencjału i wszelkie inne wsparcie dla krajów rozwijających się. „Jest to szczególnie ważne dla powodzenia zbliżającego się <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span>"" - powiedział. Xi wielokrotnie podkreślał stanowisko Chin w sprawie międzynarodowego zarządzania klimatem i wyraził zdecydowane poparcie dla porozumienia paryskiego, przyczyniając się do znacznego postępu na szczeblu światowym. W 2015 r. prezydent Xi wygłosił przemówienie inauguracyjne na paryskiej konferencji w sprawie zmian klimatu, wnosząc historyczny wkład w zawarcie tego porozumienia w sprawie działań na rzecz klimatu na świecie po 2020 r. Na początku tego miesiąca, przemawiając na szczycie przywódców 15. sesji Konferencji Stron Konwencji o różnorodności biologicznej, podkreślił wysiłki zmierzające do osiągnięcia przez Chiny celów związanych ze szczytem emisji dwutlenku węgla i neutralnością. Tegoroczny szczyt G20 odbył się zarówno w formie online, jak i offline w ramach prezydencji włoskiej, koncentrując się na najpilniejszych ogólnoświatowych wyzwaniach, z kwestiami związanymi z pandemią COVID-19, zmianą klimatu i ożywieniem gospodarczym na czele. Utworzona w 1999 roku grupa G20, w skład której wchodzi 19 państw oraz Unia Europejska, jest głównym forum współpracy międzynarodowej w kwestiach finansowych i gospodarczych. Na grupę tę przypada prawie dwie trzecie ludności świata, ponad 80 proc. światowego produktu krajowego brutto i 75 proc. światowego handlu. <u><a href=""https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-10-30/China-puts-forward-proposals-on-boosting-global-development-14MDU37P5gk/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-10-30/China-puts-forward-proposals-on-boosting-global-development-14MDU37P5gk/index.html</a></u> Materiał filmowy - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9wZBX8jYRU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9wZBX8jYRU</a>  <a title=""Link to http://www.cgtn.com"" href=""http://www.cgtn.com/"" class=""linkOnClick"" data-include="""" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cgtn.com</a><br>  SOURCE CGTN More news releases in similar topics <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 21:50 ET Share this article BRASÍLIA, <span class=""xn-location"">Brasil</span>, 2 de novembro de 2021 /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.gaabor-global.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gaabor</a>&nbsp;<u>home appliances</u>&nbsp;(Gaabor), a marca de eletrodomésticos de pequeno porte mais vendida da Alemanha, entrou oficialmente no mercado asiático <u>no segundo semestre deste ano </u>e alcançou excelentes resultados.&nbsp;No mercado do sudeste asiático, as vendas de produtos da Gaabor dispararam, e o seu principal produto, a fritadeira air fryer da Gaabor, foi vendido durante a recente Promoção Double 10.  Ao oferecer eletrodomésticos de alta qualidade, alta tecnologia e de fácil utilização, a Gaabor foi amplamente aceita pelos clientes locais. Muitos blogueiros e apresentadores de mídia social no sudeste asiático recomendaram ativamente os produtos da Gaabor para o público em programas de mídia, como TVs, Instagram, YouTube, etc. Notavelmente, a fritadeira air fryer best-seller da Gaabor conquistou o coração de muitos consumidores na Ásia, apresentando uma forma inovadora de cozinhar. A fritadeira air fryer da Gaabor possui um sistema de circulação de ar com ciclone quente e frio que fornece 360 graus de ar quente em alta velocidade ao cozinhar. Um design tão delicado pode não apenas tornar o processo de cozinhar mais fácil e saudável, mas também garante que o valor nutricional dos ingredientes possa ser melhor retido durante o cozimento. Além disso, a fritadeira air fryer da Gaabor adota um sistema de cozimento de precisão seccional e um filtro de fumaça de óleo, tornando mais fácil controlar a temperatura de cozimento de maneira estável e reduzir o óleo dos alimentos, em uma tentativa de oferecer aos usuários um método de alimentação mais saudável. Fundada no ano de 1987 em <span class=""xn-location"">Stuttgart</span> pelo empresário alemão Gabor Lorenz, a Gaabor ganhou popularidade com seus eletrodomésticos fáceis de operar. Como especialista técnico na área de eletrodomésticos, Gabor Lorenz desenvolveu sua paixão por eletrodomésticos inteligentes e desfruta da vida familiar com sua esposa e filhos.  Em 2008, o amor de Lorenz por sua filha, que estava se casando e pretendia cozinhar e se alimentar de forma saudável, o fez desenvolver e lançar a fritadeira air fryer sem fumaça da Gaabor, possibilitando que os usuários operassem facilmente os utensílios de cozinha, garantindo ao mesmo tempo o bom sabor dos alimentos. ""Há décadas posicionada como uma marca de eletrodomésticos que atende amantes de eletrodomésticos na Alemanha, a Gaabor está confiante no desenvolvimento internacional, ao mesmo tempo que mantém um ritmo cauteloso"", disse <span class=""xn-person"">James Black</span>, CEO da Gaabor. ""Esperamos vender nossos produtos de qualidade para consumidores em mais países, para que mais pessoas possam desfrutar de uma experiência de eletrodomésticos totalmente nova trazida pela Gaabor. A tentativa deste ano de entrada no mercado do sudeste asiático foi bem-sucedida, o que confirma e fortalece ainda mais a nossa expansão global"". <b>Gaabor, compartilhe a delicadeza com amor.</b>  Para mais informações, acesse o site da Gaabor:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.gaabor-global.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gaabor-global.com/</a> Contato para a imprensa:<br class=""dnr""><span class=""xn-person"">Yang Shao</span><br class=""dnr"">E-mail: <a href=""mailto:yang.shao@jetcommerce.cn"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">yang.shao@jetcommerce.cn</a> Foto - <a href=""https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1677197/Gaabor.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1677197/Gaabor.jpg</a> FONTE Gaabor  SOURCE Gaabor <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 21:49 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">GAITHERSBURG, Maryland</span> und <span class=""xn-location"">PUNE</span>, Indien, 3. <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""#financial-modal"">NVAX</a>), ein Biotechnologieunternehmen, das sich der Entwicklung und Vermarktung von Impfstoffen der nächsten Generation gegen schwere Infektionskrankheiten widmet, und Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. (SII), der weltweit größte Impfstoffhersteller, gaben heute bekannt, dass die Nationale Behörde für Arzneimittel- und Lebensmittelkontrolle der Republik Indonesien, Badan Peng was Obat dan Makanan (Badan POM), eine Notfallzulassung (EUA) für den rekombinanten Covid-19-Impfstoff&nbsp; auf Nanopartikelbasis mit dem Adjuvans Matrix-M™ erteilt hat. Es wird von SII in Indien hergestellt und von SII in Indonesien unter dem Markennamen COVOVAX™ vermarktet werden. „Die erste Zulassung des Covid-19-Impfstoffs&nbsp; von Novavax ist ein Beispiel für unser Engagement für einen gerechten globalen Zugang und wird einen lebenswichtigen Bedarf für Indonesien decken, das zwar die viertbevölkerungsreichste Nation der Erde ist, aber weiterhin daran arbeitet, genügend Impfstoff für seine Bevölkerung zu beschaffen"", sagte <span class=""xn-person"">Stanley C. Erck</span>, Präsident und Chief Executive Officer <span class=""xn-person"">von Novavax</span>. „Dies markiert auch die weltweit erste Zulassung eines proteinbasierten Covid-19-Impfstoffs auf der Grundlage von klinischen Phase-III-Daten, die Wirksamkeit und ein günstiges Sicherheitsprofil belegen. Dies ist ein Meilenstein für Novavax und unseren Partner, das Serum Institute of <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>, und es ist die erste von vielen Zulassungen, die Novavax in den kommenden Wochen und Monaten für unseren Impfstoff weltweit erwartet."" Da der Impfstoff bei 2&nbsp;° bis 8&nbsp;° Celsius gelagert wird, ist die Nutzung bestehender Impfstoff-Lieferkanäle mit herkömmlichen Kühlketten möglich, was den Zugang in schwer zugänglichen Gebieten und die Impfraten im ganzen Land erhöhen könnte. Es wird erwartet, dass die ersten Lieferungen nach Indonesien in Kürze beginnen werden. „Der Zugang zu einem sicheren und hochwirksamen Impfstoff in Verbindung mit einer einfachen Verteilung dürfte entscheidend dazu beitragen, dass Indonesien den derzeitigen Ausbruch des Coronavirus in den Griff bekommt"", sagte Adar Poonawalla, Chief Executive Officer des Serum Institute of <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>. „Wir arbeiten weiterhin mit Nachdruck daran, dass der erste proteinbasierte Covid-19-Impfstoff in Indonesien für alle verfügbar ist, die auf seine Ankunft warten."" Novavax und SII haben bereits die Zulassung des Novavax-Covid-19-Impfstoffs in Indien und auf den Philippinen sowie eine Notfallaufnahme (EUL) bei der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) beantragt. Novavax hat vor kurzem auch die laufenden Zulassungsanträge für den Novavax-Impfstoff bei den Zulassungsbehörden in Großbritannien, der Europäischen Union, Kanada und Australien abgeschlossen. Novavax geht davon aus, dass in Kürze weitere Zulassungsanträge für seinen Impfstoff in der ganzen Welt sowie ein zusätzlicher Antrag für seinen Impfstoff gegen EUL bei der WHO eingereicht werden. Novavax geht davon aus, dass es sein komplettes Paket bis Ende des Jahres bei der amerikanischen FDA einreichen wird.

Diese Informationen werden in den nächsten Tagen veröffentlicht. <b>Zugelassener Einsatz des Novavax-Covid-19-Impfstoffs&nbsp; in Indonesien <br class=""dnr""></b>Badan POM hat eine Notfallzulassung (EUA) für Covovax /Rekombinantes Spike-Protein des SARS-CoV-2-Virus 5 mcg zur Induktion einer Immunität gegen SARS-CoV-2 zur Vorbeugung von COVID-19 für Erwachsene ab 18 Jahren erteilt. <b>Wichtige Sicherheitsinformationen <br class=""dnr""></b>COVOVAX ist kontraindiziert bei Personen, die überempfindlich auf den Wirkstoff oder einen der Hilfsstoffe dieses Impfstoffs reagieren. <b>Informationen zu den Phase-III-Studien mit NVX-CoV2373 <br class=""dnr""></b>NVX-CoV2373 wird in zwei zulassungsrelevanten Phase-III-Studien untersucht: der PREVENT-19-Studie in den <span class=""xn-location"">USA</span> und Mexiko, die einen 100-prozentigen Schutz vor mittelschwerer und schwerer Krankheit und eine Gesamtwirksamkeit von 90,4&nbsp;% zeigte. Es war im Allgemeinen gut verträglich und löste eine starke Antikörperreaktion aus. Es wird auch in einer Studie in Großbritannien untersucht, die eine Wirksamkeit von 96,4&nbsp;% gegen den ursprünglichen Virusstamm, 86,3&nbsp;% gegen die Alpha-Variante (B.1.1.7) und eine Gesamtwirksamkeit von 89,7&nbsp;% ergab. NVX-CoV2373, der Covid-19-Impfstoff von Novavax, ist ein proteinbasierter Impfstoffkandidat, der aus der genetischen Sequenz des ersten Stammes von SARS-CoV-2 entwickelt wurde, dem Virus, das die Covid-19-Krankheit verursacht. NVX-CoV2373 wurde mit Hilfe der rekombinanten Nanopartikeltechnologie von Novavax entwickelt, um ein Antigen zu erzeugen, das vom Coronavirus-Spike (S)-Protein abgeleitet ist, und ist mit dem patentierten Matrix-M™-Adjuvans auf Saponinbasis von Novavax formuliert, um die Immunantwort zu verstärken und hohe Mengen neutralisierender Antikörper zu stimulieren. NVX-CoV2373 enthält gereinigtes Protein-Antigen und kann sich weder replizieren, noch kann es Covid-19 verursachen. Der Covid-19-Impfstoff von Novavax ist als gebrauchsfertige Flüssigformulierung in einer Durchstechflasche mit zehn Dosen verpackt. Das Impfschema sieht zwei 0,5-ml-Dosen (5 Mikrogramm Antigen und 50 Mikrogramm Matrix-M-Adjuvans) vor, die im Abstand von 21 Tagen intramuskulär verabreicht werden. Der Impfstoff wird bei 2° bis 8° Celsius gelagert, sodass die bestehenden Impfstoffliefer- und Kühlketten genutzt werden können. <b>Informationen zu Matrix-M™-Adjuvans <br class=""dnr""></b>Das patentierte Matrix-M™-Adjuvans auf Saponinbasis von Novavax hat eine starke und gut verträgliche Wirkung gezeigt, indem es den Eintritt von Antigen-präsentierenden Zellen in die Einstichstelle stimuliert und die Antigenpräsentation in den lokalen Lymphknoten erhöht, wodurch die Immunantwort verstärkt wird. <b>Informationen zu Novavax <br class=""dnr""></b>Novavax, Inc. (Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""#financial-modal"">NVAX</a>) ist ein Biotechnologieunternehmen, das durch die Entdeckung, Entwicklung und Vermarktung innovativer Impfstoffe zur Vorbeugung schwerer Infektionskrankheiten weltweit eine bessere Gesundheit fördert. Die firmeneigene rekombinante Technologieplattform kombiniert die Kraft und Geschwindigkeit der Gentechnik zur effizienten Herstellung von hoch immunogenen Nanopartikeln, die auf dringende globale Gesundheitsbedürfnisse ausgerichtet sind. Novavax führt derzeit klinische Studien im Spätstadium für NVX-CoV2373 durch, seinen Impfstoffkandidaten gegen SARS-CoV-2, das Virus, das Covid-19 verursacht. NanoFlu™, der quadrivalente Grippeimpfstoff auf Nanopartikelbasis, hat alle primären Ziele in der zulassungsrelevanten klinischen Phase-III-Studie bei älteren Erwachsenen erreicht und wird für die Einreichung der Zulassungsunterlagen vorbereitet. Beide Impfstoffkandidaten enthalten das Novavax-eigene Matrix-M™-Adjuvans auf Saponinbasis, um die Immunantwort zu verstärken und hohe Mengen neutralisierender Antikörper zu stimulieren.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 21:42 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-person"">NOVA YORK</span>, 2 de novembro de 2021 /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;A EDM Council, uma associação comercial intersetorial para gestão e análise de dados, lançou seu primeiro relatório de pesquisa que oferece insights e recomendações em primeira mão para a implementação de práticas recomendadas relacionadas ao gerenciamento de dados ambientais, sociais e de governança (ESG) para entidades de relatório corporativo. O relatório analisa de perto: Os relatórios ESG ainda estão nos estágios iniciais, à medida que os padrões e regulamentações são desenvolvidos e evoluem. Os relatórios ESG oferecem informações importantes sobre o desempenho, os riscos e a estratégia geral de uma empresa, e os dados resultantes são usados por várias partes interessadas em todo o ecossistema ESG, incluindo investidores, proprietários de ativos, reguladores, clientes, fornecedores e funcionários. O foco em ESG, incluindo emissões de carbono, biodiversidade, consumo de água, saúde e segurança dos funcionários, diversidade de gênero, equiparação salarial, trabalho infantil e cultura e ética, cria um conjunto único de desafios devido às complexidades associadas aos dados subjacentes e à gestão desses dados. Este documento foi desenvolvido pelo grupo de trabalho ESG do Conselho da EDM, formado em 2020 para investigar os desafios atuais de dados em todo o ecossistema ESG. O grupo de trabalho abordou o exercício analisando o problema sob o ponto de vista de um profissional de dados em cada grupo constituinte – entidade de relatório corporativo, agregador de dados/empresa de pesquisa/classificação, empresa de investimento/criação de produto e proprietário do ativo.  ""Todos estão tentando entender como incorporar princípios ESG às estratégias de suas organizações e usar dados ESG em todo o ecossistema ESG. Os dados são a cola que conecta tudo. Como resultado, os dados ESG e o gerenciamento de dados são essenciais para todos os envolvidos e ainda estão nos estágios iniciais de desenvolvimento"", disse <span class=""xn-person"">Eric Bigelsen</span>, diretor de engajamento do setor do Conselho da EDM e diretor do grupo de trabalho ESG. ""Este artigo examina considerações como preparação para relatórios de dados, onde está a responsabilidade pelos dados e orientações específicas do nosso grupo de trabalho ESG sobre as principais etapas para aprimorar as melhores práticas ESG em qualquer organização."" Este documento das entidades de relatório corporativo ESG da EDM Council é a primeira parte de uma série de documentos que incluirão os resultados de um estudo de nove meses detalhando os desafios e recomendações dos dados ESG. O relatório inclui informações de profissionais de dados em vários setores, profissionais de relatórios de sustentabilidade corporativa, especialistas no assunto ESG e outros líderes de negócios em uma iniciativa que engloba mais de 80 organizações participantes e mais de 150 profissionais.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 21:40 ET Share this article PEKING, 3. November, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Die 26. Konferenz der Vertragsparteien der Vereinten Nationen zum Klimawandel <span class=""xn-money"">(COP26)</span> wurde am Sonntag in <span class=""xn-location"">Glasgow</span>, Schottland, eröffnet, die erste Konferenz nach dem fünfjährigen Überprüfungszyklus des 2015 unterzeichneten Pariser Abkommens. Der chinesische Präsident Xi Jinping hat bei vielen Gelegenheiten Chinas Standpunkt zur Bewältigung des Klimaproblems hervorgehoben, Chinas entschiedene Unterstützung für das Pariser Abkommen zum Ausdruck gebracht und die konkreten Maßnahmen des Landes zum Schutz des Planeten angekündigt. In seiner am Montag veröffentlichten schriftlichen Erklärung an den Weltgipfel der Staats- und Regierungschefs auf der <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span> forderte Xi erneut globale Einigkeit und Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung des Klimawandels und machte drei Vorschläge. <b>Aufrechterhaltung des multilateralen Konsenses</b> „Wenn es um globale Herausforderungen wie den Klimawandel geht, ist Multilateralismus das richtige Rezept"", sagte Xi in der Erklärung und rief alle Parteien dazu auf, auf dem bestehenden Konsens aufzubauen, das gegenseitige Vertrauen zu stärken und die Zusammenarbeit zu intensivieren, um eine erfolgreiche <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span> zu erreichen. Der chinesische Präsident hat wichtige Fortschritte in Klimafragen auf globaler Ebene ermöglicht. <span class=""xn-person"">Im Jahr</span> 2015 hielt er eine Grundsatzrede auf der Pariser Klimakonferenz und leistete damit einen historischen Beitrag zum Abschluss des Pariser Abkommens Auf dem Klimagipfel im Dezember 2020 kündigte Präsident Xi die weiteren Verpflichtungen Chinas für 2030 an und machte damit stetige Fortschritte bei der Umsetzung des Pariser Abkommens. Anfang dieses Monats betonte er in seiner Rede auf dem Gipfeltreffen der Staats- und Regierungschefs der von <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> ausgerichteten 15. Konferenz der Vertragsparteien des Übereinkommens über die biologische Vielfalt <span class=""xn-money"">(COP15)</span>, wie wichtig es ist, die Früchte der grünen Entwicklung mit allen Ländern zu teilen. <b>Konzentration auf konkrete Maßnahmen</b> „Visionen werden nur dann wahr, wenn wir sie in die Tat umsetzen"", sagte Xi am Montag, als er alle Länder aufforderte, ihre Verpflichtungen einzuhalten, realistische Ziele zu setzen und ihr Bestes zu tun, um ihre Klimaschutzmaßnahmen umzusetzen. <span class=""xn-person"">Wie der</span> chinesische Präsident gesagt hat, lässt <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> seinen Worten stets Taten folgen. Laut einem in der vergangenen Woche veröffentlichten Weißbuch zum Klimawandel wird die Kohlenstoffintensität des Landes bis 2020 im Vergleich zu 2005 um 48,8 Prozent und im Vergleich zu 2015 um 18,8 Prozent sinken, was zeigt, dass <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> das Pariser Abkommen ernst nimmt. Bis Ende 2020 werden 16 Prozent des Primärenergieverbrauchs in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> auf nicht-fossile Brennstoffe entfallen, und das Land hat in den letzten zehn Jahren 120 Millionen Kilowatt installierter Kohlekraftwerkskapazität stillgelegt. <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> hat im Rahmen der Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) ebenfalls Initiativen zur Förderung grüner Infrastrukturen, Energie, Verkehr und Finanzen gestartet. <span class=""xn-person"">Im Jahr</span> 2020 entfielen 57 Prozent der chinesischen Investitionen in den BRI-Partnerländern auf Projekte im Bereich der erneuerbaren Energien, gegenüber 38 Prozent im Jahr 2019. <b>Beschleunigung des grünen Wandels</b> Xi hob am Montag die Rolle der Innovation in Wissenschaft und Technologie hervor und forderte die Förderung einer umweltfreundlicheren Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft sowie die Erkundung eines neuen Weges, der Entwicklung und Umweltschutz miteinander verbindet. <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> hat vor kurzem zwei wichtige Richtlinien veröffentlicht: ein übergeordnetes Planungsdokument für das Erreichen von Spitzenwerten bei den Kohlenstoffemissionen und die Erreichung der Kohlenstoffneutralität sowie einen Aktionsplan für das Erreichen von Spitzenwerten bei den Kohlenstoffemissionen vor 2030. Xi zufolge wird das Land weitere spezifische Umsetzungspläne für Schlüsselbereiche wie Energie, Industrie, Bauwesen und Verkehr sowie für Schlüsselsektoren wie Kohle, Elektrizität, Eisen und Stahl und Zement aufstellen, verbunden mit unterstützenden Maßnahmen in den Bereichen Wissenschaft und Technologie, Kohlenstoffsenke, Steuern und Abgaben sowie finanziellen Anreizen. Diese Pläne bilden zusammen Chinas „1+N""-Rahmenprogramm, das dem Land helfen soll, sein Versprechen zu erfüllen, seine CO2-Emissionen vor 2030 zu erreichen und bis 2060 kohlenstoffneutral zu werden, und zwar mit einem klar definierten Zeitplan, einer Roadmap und einer Blaupause. <a href=""https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-11-02/From-COP15-to-COP26-China-calls-for-unite-actions-to-protect-Earth-14R8MSzM208/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-11-02/From-COP15-to-COP26-China-calls-for-unite-actions-to-protect-Earth-14R8MSzM208/index.html</a>  <a title=""Link to http://www.cgtn.com"" href=""http://www.cgtn.com/"" class=""linkOnClick"" data-include="""" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cgtn.com</a><br>  SOURCE CGTN More news releases in similar topics <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>

""Our goal is to build generational wealth and passive income for members of the community."" Nwabuisi already has lined up several investor club, including Tribe LA – Real Estate Group, Black NFT Art – NFT Group, Break the Box – Real Estate Group, Crypto Club – Crypto Group. These clubs, and all the new ones, receive exclusive access to trusted financial communities and social payments. Money pooling channels that help you save, lend, and invest with community. Added Nwabuisi, ""These investor clubs are pooling money to combat institutional inequities. These money pools will help people buy homes, invest in startups, support Black-owned businesses and so much more."" Along with building Black wealth, Nwabuisi wants to educator Blacks about cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin will be the key driver for commerce on the internet, Nwabuisi said. Black communities dominate the internet, and Bitcoin will be the tool for them to best monetize their dominance globally. There will be increasing efforts to create, store, and transfer wealth across the internet. The good news also is that Bitcoin is a great way to store and grow wealth. Stablecoin is an effective way to store and transfer wealth (combats inflation because it's benchmarked to the dollars). And NFTs are a great way to create, store, and transfer wealth (digital art).

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 21:20 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">VANCOUVER, BC</span>, 3&nbsp;de noviembre de 2021 /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;<b>PODA HOLDINGS, INC. (""Poda"" o la ""Compañía"")&nbsp;</b>(CSE: PODA) (FSE: 99L) (OTC: PODAF)<b>&nbsp;</b>se complace en anunciar que el antiguo líder de ventas de tabaco, Christoph Tepr (""Tepr""), se ha unido a Poda. Tepr ha aceptado un próximo puesto de trabajo en la compañía como vicepresidente de Ventas de Europa y Expansión Internacional, que se espera que comience el 17 de enero de 2022. Mientras tanto, Tepr se ha unido a la Junta Asesora Global de Poda. Tepr aporta a Poda más de 15 años de experiencia comercial en algunas de las mayores empresas de tabaco y cigarrillos electrónicos del mundo, como Philip Morris, British American Tobacco y JUUL Labs. Su amplia experiencia de gestión ha abarcado las operaciones de ventas, el despliegue comercial, la gestión de la marca y los servicios profesionales, dirigiéndose a clientes de segmentos de productos y servicios maduros y emergentes. Ha dirigido el crecimiento de marcas icónicas como L&amp;M, IQOS y JUUL. En Philip Morris, Tepr ocupó varios puestos clave de ventas y gestión y fue fundamental en el despliegue del producto IQOS en el mercado suizo. En JUUL, Tepr fue contratado para crear la organización comercial suiza desde cero y, junto con su equipo, llevó a la empresa a ser líder en su categoría en los 12 meses siguientes al lanzamiento. Posteriormente, reestructuró con éxito la organización comercial alemana de JUUL. Anteriormente, ocupó un puesto de liderazgo comercial en British American Tobacco, centrándose en la comercialización y el crecimiento de su cartera de productos Heat-not-Burn y convencionales. Tepr tiene un máster en Negocios Internacionales por la Universidad de Maastricht, así como un certificado ejecutivo en Impulsar la Innovación Estratégica por el IMD de Lausana/ MIT Sloan. Tepr comentó: ""Poda es un ágil competidor en el espacio de rápido crecimiento de la tecnología ""Heat-not-Burn"". Con su plataforma tecnológica patentada, Poda representa una oportunidad única que tiene el potencial de captar una cuota de mercado significativa y, en última instancia, transformar y ampliar las áreas de aplicación dentro de la categoría, al tiempo que mejora la vida de los 1.300 millones de fumadores adultos del mundo ofreciéndoles una alternativa potencialmente menos dañina a los cigarrillos convencionales. Después de haber trabajado en empresas tabacaleras multinacionales y en la empresa de cigarrillos electrónicos de más rápido crecimiento en la historia de los Estados Unidos, espero utilizar esa experiencia para establecer las operaciones europeas de Poda, crear un equipo de primera clase y avanzar comercialmente en los principales mercados europeos"".&nbsp; <span class=""xn-person"">Ryan Selby</span>, consejero delegado de la compañía, comentó, ""Estoy encantado de que Tepr haya aceptado unirse al equipo de Poda, como miembro de nuestra Junta Asesora Global y, en enero de 2022, como vicepresidente de ventas de Europa y Expansión Internacional de Poda. Nuestro objetivo es convertir a Poda en una empresa verdaderamente global que pueda desafiar a las grandes tabacaleras, y creemos que nuestra tecnología superior Heat-not-Burn nos permitirá hacerlo. Contar con alguien con las habilidades y la experiencia de Tepr al frente del equipo de Poda en Europa será muy valioso a la hora de lanzar nuestros productos en el mercado europeo y más allá. Además, el hecho de que Tepr haya pasado prácticamente toda su carrera en las grandes tabacaleras y ahora vea el potencial de Poda para convertirse en un actor importante en la industria del tabaco de riesgo reducido dice mucho de la calidad de la tecnología ""Heat-not-Burn"" de Poda. Estos son tiempos emocionantes en Poda, y estamos encantados de que Tepr se una al equipo de Poda y lidere nuestra comercialización a través de las ventas en Europa"". Como consecuencia de su incorporación a la Junta Asesora Global de Poda, Tepr ha firmado un acuerdo de asesoramiento con la empresa. En virtud del acuerdo de asesoramiento, la empresa ha concedido un total de 400.000 opciones de compra de acciones con incentivos (las ""Opciones"") a Tepr, que pueden ejercerse a un precio de 0,56 dólares canadienses, de acuerdo con el siguiente calendario de adquisición de opciones: (a) 80.000 Opciones que se devengan a la firma del acuerdo de asesoramiento; (b) 80.000 Opciones que se devengan seis meses después de la fecha de concesión; (c) 80.000 Opciones que se devengan doce meses después de la fecha de concesión; (d) 80.000 Opciones que se devengan 18 meses después de la fecha de concesión; y (e) 80.000 Opciones que se devengan veinticuatro meses después de la fecha de concesión.

Los Poda Pods de la compañía son los primeros y únicos cigarrillos que tienen un extremo completamente cerrado. Este diseño exclusivo elimina por completo todos los requisitos de limpieza y proporciona un cigarrillo HnB verdaderamente sin cenizas. El sistema totalmente patentado de Poda es verdaderamente único en su tipo y resuelve el principal problema que sufren los demás productos HnB: los requisitos de limpieza diaria. Las cápsulas destacadas&nbsp;<b>Beyond Burn™&nbsp;</b>Poda de la compañía contienen una mezcla única de hojas de té granuladas sin tabaco infundidas con nicotina sintética, que brinda a los fumadores adultos una alternativa libre de humo a su hábito habitual sin sacrificar la satisfacción a la que están acostumbrados.

Their intention is to create a space where mindful discovery, discussion, and community take place with a group of people who have similar life experiences. Users will be able to curate the content they share on their profiles through creating boards, similar to Pinterest. This takes curating across the community to the next level. Lastly, 7th Ave offers a range of audio features that connect users based on their interest, allowing users to foster relationships at a quicker and deeper pace.  7th Ave is a community platform aggregating the Black digital experience. 7th Ave acts as your one stop show allowing users to integrate content they consume across the internet all in one place.

Lastly, 7th Ave offers a range of audio features that connect users based on their interest, allowing users to foster relationships at a quicker and deeper pace.  <span>The Black community has a massive digital footprint globally (<span class=""xn-money"">1.2B</span>). In an era of tik tok dances and internet trends starting within the Black community, many creatives are frustrated by the lack of protection and credit they receive online (ex. <u><span><a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344847-1&amp;h=886048470&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2F2021%2F07%2F01%2F1011899328%2Fblack-tiktok-creators-are-on-strike-to-protest-a-lack-of-credit-for-their-work&amp;a=Black+Tik+Tok+creators+on+strike"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Black <span class=""xn-person"">Tik Tok</span> creators on strike</span></a></span></u>). Today, there is a huge void in the Black digital experience. The homes and spaces that have housed Black culture and community in the physical world, do not translate to the digital world. Additionally, the owners of the platforms most commonly used today are not Black-owned. </span> <span>""Our mission is to create a space that celebrates Blackness in all its forms,"" says cofounder <span class=""xn-person"">Brylan Donaldson</span>. ""We see 7th Ave as a tool for our community. A tool that can help connect us globally and build a foundation for honoring, hosting and harnessing the power of Black communities, IN community.""</span> <span>7th Ave believes in order to build for the community, they must build with the community. This is why they have gone boots on the ground in cities like LA, NY, ATL, HTX, and DC collaborating with various events, vendors, and creatives to ask folks exactly what they want. Cofounder <span class=""xn-person"">Diaundra Jones</span> says, ""we want to celebrate the intersectionality and diversity of the Black community, which is why it's so important to be with the people and hear directly from them what they would want their digital home to look like. Being feet on the ground has allowed us to take in so many different perspectives and ideas. We believe community is everything."" Along with building with the community, the team believes in celebrating the community. They have released various community spotlights, podcasts, and newsletter all centered around amplifying the work and craft of the community. </span> <span>""We believe home is a state of mind, one that starts within us,"" says Diaundra. ""Home can take on many definitions, but one constant remains: Home is the place that you can authentically be yourself. We want to create the space for our community to feel seen and heard. Our mission is to ensure no matter where we are physically on this earth, that we always feel like we have a place to call home."" </span> <span>""7th Ave is addressing a community concern that has been left unfilled for far too long,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Marlon Nichols</span>, founding managing partner at MaC Venture Capital.&nbsp; ""We are in a time where physiological safety online needs to be front and center. It's great to see the team focus on general community empathy and empowerment.""<b>&nbsp;</b>MaC Venture Capital has backed impressive companies such as Blavity, Gimlet Media, Pipe, Thrive Market and Wonderschool to name a few. </span> <span>""We firmly believe in the future of audio-first market opportunities, especially one that centers on and is built by the Black experience. 7th Ave allows Black creatives and creators a space to flourish and thrive,"" says <span class=""xn-person"">Arlan Hamilton</span>, founder and Managing Partner of Backstage Capital. ""Brylan and Diaundra are building for the community by focusing on its needs.""</span> <span>7th Ave has officially launched to the app store, in which Brylan shares he ""feels so grateful to the team and our partners for believing in us and building with us. We carry the responsibility everyday of building something that has the power to empower our community in a beautiful way. Less than 2% of people who look like us have the opportunity to be funded.

The article further stated that ""although Novavax recently attested to some of its analytics and testing issues … the company's issues are more concerning than previously understood, according to two of the people with direct knowledge of the matter.""

When used in this news release the words ""expect"", ""will"", ""could"", ""would"", ""believe"", ""continue"", ""pursue"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. In particular, this news release contains forward-looking statements with respect to, among other things, business objectives and strategies, Parkland's expectation of achieving the upper end of its 2021 Adjusted EBITDA guidance and achieving its 2021 co-processing target and long-term growth ambitions, expected benefits and synergies to be derived from acquisitions, expected closing dates of announced transactions, expecting timing of Parkland publishing its second sustainability report, and Parkland's ability to advance its growth agenda. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this news release. Parkland does not undertake any obligations to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by securities law. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of numerous risks, assumptions and uncertainties including, but not limited to, general economic, market and business conditions, including the duration and impact of the COVID pandemic; Parkland's ability to execute its business strategies, including without limitation, Parkland's ability to consistently identify accretive acquisition targets and successfully integrate them, successfully implement organic growth initiatives and to finance such acquisitions and initiatives on reasonable terms; Parkland's ability to grow its supply advantage by leveraging its scale and infrastructure; industry capacity; competitive action by other companies; refining and marketing margins; the ability of suppliers to meet commitments; actions by governmental authorities and other regulators including but not limited to increases in taxes or restricted access to markets; changes and developments in environmental and other regulations; and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Parkland.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted gross margin are measures of segment profit and non-GAAP financial measures. Total funded debt to credit facility EBITDA ratio, Adjusted earnings, distributable cash flow, and distributable cash flow per share attributable to Parkland are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and may not be comparable to similar financial measures used by other issuers. Management considers these to be important supplemental measures of Parkland's performance and believes these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. <span class=""xn-person"">See Section</span> 14 of the Q3 2021 MD&amp;A for a discussion of non-GAAP measures, the reasons Parkland considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis and their reconciliations to the nearest applicable IFRS measure.  In addition to non-GAAP financial measures, Parkland uses a number of operational KPIs, such as Company C-Store SSSG, refinery utilization and composite refinery utilization, to measure the success of our strategic objectives and to set variable compensation targets for employees. These KPIs are not accounting measures, do not have comparable IFRS measures, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers, as other issuers may calculate these metrics differently. <span class=""xn-person"">See Section</span> 14 of the Q3 2021 MD&amp;A for further details.  Investors are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings determined in accordance with IFRS as an indication of Parkland's performance.

The offering was priced at&nbsp;$10.00&nbsp;per unit, resulting in gross proceeds of <span class=""xn-money"">$230,000,000</span>. The units are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market (""Nasdaq"") and commenced trading under the ticker symbol ""AEAEU"" on <span class=""xn-chron"">October 29, 2021</span>.  Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant, each whole warrant exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of&nbsp;$11.50&nbsp;per share. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the shares of Class A common stock and warrants are expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the symbols ""AEAE"" and ""AEAEW,"" respectively. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. On <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2, 2021</span>, simultaneously with the underwriter's exercise of the overallotment option, the Company consummated a private sale of&nbsp;11,600,000 million private placement warrants to the sponsor, AltEnergy&nbsp;Acquisition Sponsor, LLC, and 400,000 private placement warrants to an affiliate of the underwriter, at a purchase price of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.00</span> per private warrant, generating gross proceeds of <span class=""xn-money"">$12,000,000</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more business.

A registration statement relating to these securities was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on <span class=""xn-chron"">October 28, 2021</span>.

We have not selected any business combination targets, and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination targets. While we may pursue an initial business combination in any industry, we intend to focus our efforts on businesses that leverage our management team's experience in acquiring and operating businesses that are involved in renewable energy or related clean technology, which we refer to as the alternative energy sector.

 Cupertino Tops Rankings; Big Jumps in Orinda, Larkspur, Martinez News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 20:26 ET Share this article  <span class=""legendSpanClass""><span class=""xn-location"">SAN FRANCISCO</span></span>, <span class=""legendSpanClass""><span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span></span> /PRNewswire/ -- Overall pavement conditions on the Bay Area's nearly 44,000 lane-miles of local streets and roads landed once again in fair territory last year, with the typical stretch of roadway showing serious wear and likely to require rehabilitation soon. Data released today by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) put the region's 2020 pavement condition index (PCI) score at 67 out of a maximum possible 100 points, as computed on a three-year moving average basis. This marks the fifth consecutive year Bay Area streets and roads have registered an average score of 67 and underscores the continuing challenges faced by cities' and counties' public works departments. ""Some of the pavement work scheduled for last year was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" observed MTC Chair and <span class=""xn-location"">Napa County</span> Supervisor <span class=""xn-person"">Alfredo Pedroza</span>. ""But the new scores illustrate how big a challenge it is to bring our roads — not just in <span class=""xn-location"">Napa County</span> but all around the Bay Area — to a state of good repair. Local streets and roads money from the SB 1 transportation package is helping counties and cities hold the line against deterioration, but our goal at MTC is to raise the region's average PCI score into the mid-80s. The data give us a real appreciation for just how many miles of roadway the Bay Area has and a reminder of how old a lot of our pavement is, too."" PCI scores of 90 or higher are considered ""excellent."" These are newly built or resurfaced streets that show little or no distress. Pavement with a PCI score in the 80 to 89 range is considered ""very good"" and shows only slight or moderate distress, requiring primarily preventive maintenance. The ""good"" category ranges from 70 to 79, while streets with PCI scores in the ""fair"" (60-69) range are becoming worn to the point where rehabilitation may be needed to prevent rapid deterioration. Because major repairs cost five to 10 times more than routine maintenance, these streets are at an especially critical stage. Roadways with PCI scores of 50 to 59 are deemed ""at-risk,"" while those with PCI scores of 25 to 49 are considered ""poor."" These roads require major rehabilitation or reconstruction. Pavement with a PCI score below 25 is considered ""failed."" &nbsp; <span class=""xn-location"">San Francisco</span>, with a three-year moving average score of 74, is the only one of the Bay Area's three largest cities to crack the ""good"" category. <span class=""xn-location"">San Jose</span>, which has by far the largest street network in the Bay Area, held steady last year with a score of 66. Meanwhile, pavement conditions became even more ""at risk"" on the average street in <span class=""xn-location"">Oakland</span>, with the city's three-year moving average slipping to just 52 from 53 in 2019 and 54 in 2018. <span class=""xn-location"">Cupertino</span> tops the list of Bay Area pavement rankings for the 2018-20 period, with an average PCI score of 85. Other cities with three-year PCI scores in the ""very good"" range include <span class=""xn-location"">Dublin</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Palo Alto</span> (84); <span class=""xn-location"">Brentwood</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Clayton</span>, Orinda and <span class=""xn-location"">Woodside</span> (81); and <span class=""xn-location"">Danville</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Foster City</span> and unincorporated <span class=""xn-location"">Solano County</span> (80). The lowest-ranked pavement in the Bay Area was found in <span class=""xn-location"">Pacifica</span>, which recorded a PCI score of 42 for 2018-20. The only other jurisdictions with three-year average PCI scores in the ""poor"" range are <span class=""xn-location"">Petaluma</span> (44), unincorporated <span class=""xn-location"">Napa County</span> (45), <span class=""xn-location"">Sebastopol</span> (48) and <span class=""xn-location"">Vallejo</span> (49). The three-year moving average PCI score for the nearly 2,700 lane-miles of rural roads in unincorporated <span class=""xn-location"">Sonoma County</span> last year inched into the ""at-risk"" range (50) after many years in the ""poor"" bracket and a PCI score of 49 for the 2017-19 period. Much larger improvements in pavement conditions were registered last year in the <span class=""xn-location"">Contra Costa County</span> cities of Orinda and <span class=""xn-location"">Martinez</span>, and in the <span class=""xn-location"">Marin County</span> city of <span class=""xn-location"">Larkspur</span>. In <span class=""xn-location"">Larkspur</span>, the three-year average PCI score rose to 59 for the 2018-20 period from 46 just two years earlier. In <span class=""xn-location"">Martinez</span>, the city's three-year average PCI score rose to 64 last year from 55 in 2018, while Orinda's three-year average score jumped all the way to 81 from 68 in the 2016-18 reporting period. ""It's gratifying to see the big rise in our street scores,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Orinda Mayor</span> and MTC Commissioner <span class=""xn-person"">Amy Rein Worth</span>, recalling the not-so-distant years when the city's pavement rankings were among the lowest in the Bay Area. ""Orinda voters deserve huge credit. Back in 2012, they decided good pavement is worth paying for, and approved our quarter-cent Measure L sales tax to supplement the street maintenance money Orinda gets from the Measure J sales tax approved by voters throughout <span class=""xn-location"">Contra Costa County</span>. We got another shot in the arm a few years ago when the state dollars from SB 1 started flowing. And we've been lucky enough so far through the pandemic to complete our pavement projects as scheduled.""

""El nombramiento de un académico de Humanidades es una elección audaz, que parte de varias décadas de directores formados en ciencias y matemáticas, pero reafirma en el sentido más fuerte la importancia de la colaboración interdisciplinaria"", afirmó <span class=""xn-person"">Charles Simonyi</span>, presidente de la junta directiva del IAS. ""David, un líder enérgico y astuto, entiende que el Instituto es un bien público al servicio de la sociedad"".

El Instituto también ha prestado servicio a la nación y al mundo a través de la aplicación constante de sus valores fundacionales: que la discriminación por género y raza son incompatibles con la excelencia, que los académicos y las ideas deben moverse libremente para que prospere el conocimiento fundamental y que cuando prospera el conocimiento, la humanidad se beneficia"", afirmó Nirenberg.  Nirenberg ha formado parte de la Junta del Laboratorio Nacional de Argonne y del Centro Nacional de Investigación de Opinión. Es miembro electo de las secciones de Historia y Filosofía/Religión de la American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court <b>no later than <span class=""xn-chron"">December 20, 2021</span></b>. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. <b>WHY ROSEN LAW: </b>We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over <span class=""xn-money"">$438 million</span> for investors. In 2020, founding partner <span class=""xn-person"">Laurence Rosen</span> was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. <b>DETAILS OF THE CASE: </b>According to the lawsuit, the Registration Statement was materially false and misleading and omitted to state that: (1) Hepsiburada suffered a sharp deceleration in operational and sales growth during second quarter 2021; (2) as a result, Hepsiburada initiated certain actions to fortify its competitive position, including investing in electronics and high frequency categories and discounting certain categories; (3) as a result of the foregoing, Hepsiburada's revenue and gross merchandise value had declined during second quarter 2021; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendants' positive statements about Hepsiburada's business, operations, and prospects, were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Hepsiburada class action, go to <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344952-1&amp;h=1492388674&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rosenlegal.com%2Fcases-register-2175.html&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rosenlegal.com%2Fcases-register-2175.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-register-2175.html</a> or call <span class=""xn-person"">Phillip Kim, Esq.</span> toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a href=""mailto:pkim@rosenlegal.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pkim@rosenlegal.com</a> or <a href=""mailto:cases@rosenlegal.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cases@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 20:08 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">SINGAPORE</span>, Nov.&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2021 /PRNewswire/ -- <u><a href=""http://www.marspanda.world/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mars Panda</a></u>, one of the first Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Marketplace platforms with a complete know your customer (KYC) solution is officially launching after powering Blockchain Association Singapore (BAS) and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) U Care Fund NFT charity auction event, 'Blockchain For Good', to a successful completion.  The auction took place over a week in <span class=""xn-location"">Singapore</span>, from <span class=""xn-chron"">4th October 2021</span> to <span class=""xn-chron"">17th October 2021</span>, and supported by partners including Ether Cards, Singapore Airlines, KrisShop, Singapore FinTech Festival, Drew &amp; Napier LLC, Amazon Web Services (AWS), <span class=""xn-person"">Aleta Planet</span>, Nexia TS, Ode To Art Gallery, Coinhako, Regtank Technology and Mars Panda. Blockchain For Good raised more than the initial target of <span class=""xn-money"">$250,000</span> for the NTUC-U Care Fund, and the proceeds raised will go towards supporting several assistance initiatives, such as helping families with living expenses and education fees for their children, as well as caring for the elderly. The NFT platform powered by Mars Panda and hosted by BAS is one of the first NFT platforms with a built-in KYC solution by RegTank. BAS has partnered with Mars Panda for the platform's unique qualities of security, ease of use and the ability to host both virtual and real world assets NFTs. To mark the NFT Marketplace's official launch, Mars Panda has collaborated with Yang Amat Mulia Pengiran Anak Hamlatul Arsy Mulia daughter of HRH Prince Haji Sufri Bolkiah by minting 5 NFTs from the princess' 'The Hidden Princess' collection on the platform.  'The Hidden Princess' is a collection of 412 artworks consisting of a mix of animation, digital and traditional paintings. In addition, some pieces will be in mixed media like paper and recycled materials. The collection will be showcased in a solo show on the <span class=""xn-chron"">22nd February 2022</span>. Out of these 412 pieces, only 10 pieces will be minted as NFTs before the show. These 10 NFTs will also serve as an invitation to the solo show on opening day, and entitles the NFT holder to attend a private tour with the artist. The princess' NFT titled 'Protector of the Soul' from the same collection sold for <span class=""xn-money"">$50,000</span> in the NTUC charity auction. This digital piece titled 'The Light Within' is part of the same collection and will be minted on the Mars Panda NFT Marketplace. The princess has pledged that a portion of the sales from this piece will be donated to UNHCR (United Nations High Commission for Refugees) and their efforts to support refugees, a movement that she has always been passionate about. ""It is my goal to start an artist development fund to support promising ASEAN artists, especially providing underprivileged artists with an opportunity to be able to kickstart a journey into the creative world and embrace the benefits of NFTs. Mars Panda is a springboard for this and I believe the coming NFT revolution will empower many more to be able to craft a life for themselves and more."" - <b>Yang Amat Mulia Pengiran Anak Hamlatul Arsy Mulia daughter of HRH Prince Haji Sufri Bolkiah and Corporate Social Responsibility Ambassador for Mars Panda</b> ""We are glad that the Mars Panda NFT platform ran smoothly and the compliance onboarding worked successfully as intended. We are thrilled to have helped NTUC raise the money to support the recipients and humbled to have been involved in this worthwhile cause for our launch event. The success of this charity auction is testimonial to our technology, and we have received several requests from non-profit organisations to support their initiatives. We are looking at charity auctions on a global scale next, and we hope to show the world that the NFT space can be both a force for good and a compliant one."" -‌ <b>‌‌Mr Kevin Pang, CEO, Mars Panda</b> <b>About Mars Panda</b> <i><u><a href=""http://www.marspanda.world/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mars Panda</a></u> is a complete eco-system which consists of:</i> <i>We aim to fuse mainstream eCommerce and Gaming to the crypto world of NFTs and DeFi, on one seamless, unified platform.</i> <b>About Blockchain Association Singapore</b> <i>Blockchain Association Singapore (BAS) is an effective platform for members to engage with multiple stakeholders–both regional and international–to discover solutions and promote best practices in a collaborative, open, and transparent manner.

La película de la campaña, que puede verse <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDK9qxbRnC0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aqui</a>, incluye a miembros del equipo real que se enorgullecen de sostener cajas de pizza que muestran los pequeños cambios que Papa John's ha implementado en varios países del mundo para promover el amor por el bien del planeta. Entre ellos figuran los siguientes:  La campaña de marketing internacional complementa los lanzamientos de productos a base de vegetales adicionales en varios mercados, incluyendo más opciones de queso y ""NoChicken"" (sin pollo) a base de vegetales, así como las opciones de Papadia a base de vegetales. Un reto global en las redes sociales #pizzaboxpromise apoya la campaña Plant Love, en la que se les pregunta a los clientes qué hacen para promover el amor por el planeta y se escriben sus respuestas en una caja de pizza de Papa John's.&nbsp;  La última campaña global es una evolución de la campaña ""<i><span class=""xn-person"">Love Pizza</span>, Love The Planet""</i>, que se llevó a cabo a principios de año y promovió la importancia de la naturaleza y los ingredientes naturales en las pizzas de Papa John's.  <span class=""xn-person"">Jo Blundell</span>, vicepresidente de Marketing internacional de Papa John's, comentó: ""Estamos en una trayectoria para seguir plantando las pequeñas semillas de cambio en beneficio de nuestros clientes y las comunidades del planeta. Por lo tanto, solo nos parecía correcto poner a los miembros de nuestro equipo de Papa John's en nuestra última campaña de marketing global Plant Love, que muestra las pequeñas pero significativas iniciativas que hemos tomado en conjunto para promover el amor por el planeta"".  El movimiento Plant Love complementa la promesa de Papa John's ""mejor pizza, mejores ingredientes"" y el papel de la naturaleza en el mejoramiento de las pizzas. Los ingredientes a base de vegetales se pueden encontrar en la masa de seis ingredientes frescos no congelados de la marca y en sus tomates madurados en la planta incorporados en salsa de pizza y coberturas de vegetales, así como en alternativas de queso y carne a base de vegetales como Sheese y ""NoChicken"".&nbsp;  Como parte de su compromiso de alentar a los clientes a reciclar, Papa John's siempre está explorando formas de hacer que su gama de empaques sea aún más sostenible.&nbsp; <b><u>Notas a los editores</u></b><b>&nbsp;</b> Para obtener más información sobre la nueva campaña Plant Love Pizza Box Pledge, o sobre cualquiera de los platos disponibles en el menú de Papa John's, visite&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.papajohns.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PapaJohns.com</a>. <b>Acerca de Papa John's</b>&nbsp; Papa John's World, Inc.&nbsp;(NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/papa-john-s-promete-amor-por-el-planeta-848314906.html#financial-modal"">PZZA</a>) abrió sus puertas en 1984 con un objetivo en mente: MEJORES INGREDIENTES. <span class=""xn-person"">MEJOR PIZZA</span>.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 19:47 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">SHENZHEN</span>, Chiny, 3&nbsp;listopada 2021 r. /PRNewswire/ -- Po ponad roku od wprowadzenia na rynek, inteligentna wyszukiwarka mobilna Petal Search firmy Huawei odnotowała znaczny wzrost udziału w rynku i dokłada wszelkich starań, aby wspierać firmy w ich rozwoju. Podczas corocznej konferencji Huawei Developer Conference 2021 (HDC 2021), marka zaprezentowała szereg nowych możliwości Petal Search, z których mogą korzystać zarówno przedsiębiorstwa, jak i deweloperzy. Petal Search oferuje przełomowe narzędzia, które zaspokoją potrzeby firm dążących do rozwoju, zarówno tych, które dopiero wchodzą na rynek, jak i tych, które cieszą się już ugruntowaną pozycją. <b>Petal Search nawiązuje strategiczne relacje partnerskie, by pobudzić firmy do działania</b> Współpracując z Petal Search, przedsiębiorstwa będą mogły wykorzystać ekosystem i otwartość technologiczną mobilnej wyszukiwarki do realizacji swoich celów i strategii biznesowych. Trajektoria wzrostu Petal Search jest imponująca i nie wykazuje oznak spowolnienia. Od września bieżącego roku mobilna wyszukiwarka zanotowała wzrost o 32 miliony miesięcznych aktywnych użytkowników. Dodatkowo Petal Search jest jedną z głównych wyszukiwarek mobilnych w większości regionów - co przekłada się na ogromną bazę użytkowników i szerokie grono odbiorców dla każdego z partnerów platformy. Petal Search 2.0 oferuje szeroki wachlarz narzędzi wspomagających międzynarodowych partnerów w efektywnej dystrybucji treści, w tym Petal Merchant Center, Petal Travel Center i Business Connect, które zapewniają usługi dostosowane do indywidualnych potrzeb i wyzwań każdej firmy. Petal Merchant Center zapewnia sprzedawcom narzędzia do wystawiania swoich produktów i organizowania promocji handlowych w celu uzyskania widoczności, Petal Travel Center obsługuje sektor turystyczny i hotelarski, zaś Business Connect detalistów handlu elektronicznego i sprzedawców podmiotowych. <b>Umożliwienie partnerom wykorzystywania możliwości nowej generacji</b> Petal Search udostępnia również swój pakiet narzędzi dla firm i deweloperów za pośrednictwem Search Kit, umożliwiając kontrahentom optymalizację procesu wyszukiwania w aplikacjach mobilnych. System Search Kit jest wyposażony w szereg inteligentnych funkcji, takich jak wyszukiwanie wizualne, wyszukiwanie głosowe, tłumaczenie OCR, zamiana tekstu na mowę, wyszukiwanie zakupów, hoteli i wiele innych, dając użytkownikom dostęp do wiedzy akademickiej, łączenia podmiotów i grafów wiedzy. Dodatkowo zestaw ten zawiera cały pakiet rozwiązań, takich jak autosugestia, wiadomości, wideo, sieć, zakupy, wyszukiwanie hoteli i szereg innych, pozwalających przedsiębiorstwom na elastyczne dotarcie do odpowiednich odbiorców, w oparciu o ich indywidualne potrzeby.

Firmy, które zamierzają sprawdzić swoją produktywność w codziennej działalności, mogą skorzystać z dodatkowej funkcji śledzenia wyników i kliknięć w Petal Travel Center. Dzięki optymalizacji wyszukiwania, Petal Travel Center sprawia, że informacje o lotach, hotelach i atrakcjach turystycznych w danym mieście są wyjątkowo łatwo dostępne. W szczególności hotele mogą zarządzać informacjami, listami, cenami i stronami docelowymi, aby zoptymalizować punkty kontaktowe oraz zwiększyć ruch i wykorzystanie. Funkcja wyszukiwania hoteli rekomenduje użytkownikom marki hotelowe i przenosi ich na oficjalne strony tych marek, zapewniając potencjalnym klientom łatwy dostęp do nich. Hotelarze mają możliwość korzystania z PTC w celu przesyłania danych o hotelach i pozyskiwania organicznego ruchu w wyszukiwarkach w ramach rozległego ekosystemu HMS.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 19:41 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">BEIJING</span>, 3 de noviembre de 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- La 26<sup>a</sup> Conferencia de las Partes de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático <span class=""xn-money"">(COP26)</span> se inauguró el domingo en <span class=""xn-location"">Glasgow</span>, Escocia, la primera conferencia después del ciclo de revisión de cinco años en virtud del Acuerdo de París firmado en 2015. El presidente chino, Xi Jinping, ha destacado en muchas ocasiones la opinión de <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> sobre la lucha contra el cambio climático, ha expresado su firme apoyo al Acuerdo de París y ha anunciado las acciones concretas del país para proteger el planeta. En su declaración escrita a la Cumbre de Líderes Mundiales en la <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span> publicada el lunes, Xi reiteró un llamamiento a la unidad global y acciones para abordar el cambio climático y lanzó tres sugerencias. <b>Mantener el consenso multilateral </b> ""Cuando se trata de desafíos globales como el cambio climático, el multilateralismo es la receta correcta"", dijo Xi en el comunicado, pidiendo a todas las partes que se basen en el consenso existente, aumenten la confianza mutua e intensifiquen la cooperación para lograr una <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span> exitosa. El presidente chino ha facilitado importantes avances en cuestiones climáticas a nivel mundial. En 2015, pronunció un discurso de apertura en la Conferencia de París sobre el Cambio Climático, haciendo una contribución histórica a la conclusión del Acuerdo de París. En la Cumbre sobre la ambición climática en diciembre de 2020, el presidente Xi anunció los nuevos compromisos de <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> para 2030, con un progreso constante en la implementación del Acuerdo de París. A principios de este mes, recalcó la importancia de compartir los frutos del desarrollo verde entre todos los países cuando se dirigió a la cumbre de líderes de la 15<sup>a</sup> reunión de la Conferencia de las Partes del Convenio sobre la Diversidad Biológica <span class=""xn-money"">(COP15)</span> organizada por <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. <b>Centrarse en acciones concretas</b> ""Las visiones se harán realidad solo cuando actuemos sobre ellas"", dijo Xi el lunes, mientras exhortaba a todos los países a honrar su compromiso, establecer objetivos realistas y hacer todo lo posible de acuerdo con las condiciones nacionales para implementar sus medidas de acción climática. Tal y como ha dicho el presidente chino, <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> siempre honra sus palabras con acciones. Según un libro blanco sobre el cambio climático publicado la semana pasada, la intensidad de las emisiones de carbono del país en 2020 se redujo en un 48,8 por ciento en comparación con 2005 y en un 18,8 por ciento con respecto al nivel de 2015, lo que muestra que <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> se toma en serio el Acuerdo de París. A finales de 2020, los combustibles no fósiles representaron el 16 por ciento del consumo de energía primaria en <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> y el país también eliminó 120 millones de kilovatios de capacidad instalada de generación de energía a carbón durante la última década. <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> también ha lanzado iniciativas de acción ecológica que fomentan la infraestructura, la energía, el transporte y las finanzas ecológicos en el marco de la Iniciativa de la Franja y la Ruta (BRI). En 2020, el 57 por ciento de la inversión de <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> en los países socios de BRI se destinó a proyectos de energía renovable, frente al 38 por ciento en 2019. <b>Acelerando la transición verde </b> Xi destacó el lunes el papel de la innovación en la ciencia y la tecnología y pidió la promoción de una economía y una sociedad más ecológicas y la exploración de una nueva vía que coordine el desarrollo con la conservación. <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> ha publicado recientemente dos directivas clave: un documento de diseño de alto nivel para alcanzar el máximo de las emisiones de carbono y lograr la neutralidad del carbono, y un plan de acción para alcanzar el máximo de las emisiones de carbono antes de 2030. Según Xi, el país seguirá llevando a la práctica planes de implementación específicos para áreas clave como la energía, industria, construcción y transporte, y para sectores clave como el carbón, electricidad, hierro y acero y cemento, junto con medidas de apoyo en términos de ciencia y tecnología, sumidero de carbono, incentivos fiscales e impuestos e incentivos financieros. Estos planes juntos formarán el marco de política ""1+N"" de <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> para ayudar a la nación a cumplir su compromiso de alcanzar el máximo de sus emisiones de CO2 antes de 2030 y lograr la neutralidad de carbono antes de 2060 con un calendario, una hoja de ruta y un plan claramente definidos. <a href=""https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-11-02/From-COP15-to-COP26-China-calls-for-unite-actions-to-protect-Earth-14R8MSzM208/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-11-02/From-COP15-to-COP26-China-calls-for-unite-actions-to-protect-Earth-14R8MSzM208/index.html</a>  <a title=""Link to http://www.cgtn.com"" href=""http://www.cgtn.com/"" class=""linkOnClick"" data-include="""" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cgtn.com</a><br>  SOURCE CGTN More news releases in similar topics <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>

 A solução totalmente gerenciada oferece à MCTV mais controle e garante transmissões de vídeo de qualidade superior para assinantes em qualquer tela News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 19:37 ET Share this article MARKHAM, ONTÁRIO e&nbsp;NOVA YORK, 2 de novembro de 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- A<b>&nbsp;Enghouse Networks</b>, líder global em tecnologia de telecomunicações e provedora de soluções de plataforma SaaS IPTV, e a Broadpeak®, provedora líder de soluções de streaming de vídeo para provedores de conteúdo e operadoras de TV paga em todo o mundo, anunciaram hoje que estão unindo forças para otimizar o serviço de streaming de vídeo da MCTV, uma operadora a cabo com sede em <span class=""xn-location"">Ohio</span>.  A MCTV está implementando uma solução preparada para o futuro da Broadpeak e da Enghouse para garantir serviços de alta qualidade aos assinantes em uma ampla gama de dispositivos, como Fire TV e Android™.&nbsp; ""Substituímos nossa plataforma de vídeo anterior por uma solução da Broadpeak e da Enghouse para continuar a melhorar e fortalecer o futuro de nossas ofertas de produtos de vídeo"", disse <span class=""xn-person"">Katherine Gessner</span>, presidente da MCTV. ""A MCTV tem orgulho de fornecer qualidade superior e oferece uma experiência excepcional aos clientes. Aproveitando a competência da Broadpeak em oferecer&nbsp;vídeos com uma experiência de usuário de alta qualidade habilitada pela Enghouse, garantimos a experiência de streaming perfeita.""&nbsp; A MCTV utilizará a avançada solução CDN, o gerenciador de entrega de vídeos BkM100, os servidores de cache de vídeo BkS400 HTTP e o pacote de origem BkS350 da Broadpeak para oferecer TV ao vivo, reprises, NPVR e conteúdo VOD aos assinantes do MCTV Stream.

The Rosen Law firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses. <b>WHAT TO DO NEXT: </b>To join the prospective class action, go to <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344976-1&amp;h=3178277569&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rosenlegal.com%2Fcases-register-2189.html&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rosenlegal.com%2Fcases-register-2189.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-register-2189.html</a>&nbsp;or call <span class=""xn-person"">Phillip Kim, Esq.</span> toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email <a href=""mailto:pkim@rosenlegal.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pkim@rosenlegal.com</a> or <a href=""mailto:cases@rosenlegal.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cases@rosenlegal.com</a> for information on the class action. <b>WHAT IS THIS ABOUT:</b>&nbsp;On <span class=""xn-chron"">October 26, 2021</span>, Lockheed Martin announced its third quarter 2021 financial results. In its report, Lockheed Martin indicated that it would incur a <span class=""xn-money"">$1.7 billion</span> non-cash pension settlement charge, which would decrease the company's net income by <span class=""xn-money"">$4.72</span> per share.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 19:25 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">ANN ARBOR, Mich.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;Ann Arbor Public Schools Dropout Recovery and Prevention Program graduated its 100<sup>th</sup> student this summer, providing an important credential to Michiganders who otherwise might have not achieved this important milestone. Since 2018, the program has continued to grow, with more graduates every month. ""This program has been incredibly effective for students - especially during the pandemic - by guiding those enrolled to the goal of earning a diploma,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Paul DeAngelis</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Ann Arbor's</span> Executive Director for High School Education. ""We look forward to continued growth and success as we navigate the ever-shifting educational landscape. Programs like this with Graduation Alliance are important to our work of serving students through alternatives to the traditional high school setting."" Dropout Recovery programs like the one in <span class=""xn-location"">Ann Arbor</span> provide an important complement to the traditional high school experience. While in-person instruction is always the goal, some students face roadblocks and barriers that make a regular school day impossible. These programs help students rise above these obstacles and still earn a high school diploma from their local district. Students enrolled in the program are provided with a wifi-enabled laptop computer to complete their coursework at any time and from anywhere. They also are given access to 24/7 tutoring resources, Academic Coaches for guidance, and Local Advocates who help navigate obstacles. Comprehensive layers of support are key, and students are paired with a dedicated one-on-one support staff to help stay engaged and on track with their studies.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 1 million <span class=""xn-location"">Michigan</span> adults do not have a high school diploma. In 2020, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics stated, ""High school graduates make an average of <span class=""xn-money"">$9,200</span> more per year than people without a diploma."" This program has brought educational and economic opportunity to hard-working students who faced challenges finishing high school in a conventional manner. As students make their way to school this fall, many will find the transition back to a traditional school day difficult and, in some cases, logistically impossible. For these students, an alternative path, like the one offered through the <span class=""xn-location"">Ann Arbor</span> Public Schools Dropout Recovery and Prevention Program, may be the best choice to continue their education.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 19:12 ET Share this article MONTRÉAL, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ - Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (""Turquoise Hill"" or the ""Company"") today announced its financial results for the period ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>. All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. ""Oyu Tolgoi produced solid operating results in the third quarter. Copper production of 41,935 tonnes was up 16% year-over-year and 14% relative to Q2'21. The mine also produced 130,799 ounces of gold in the quarter, an increase of 256% compared to the same quarter last year and 16% more than was produced in Q2'21. Revenue for the quarter was <span class=""xn-money"">$622.8 million</span>, an increase of 135.6% from Q3'20 revenue of <span class=""xn-money"">$264.4 million</span>. Thanks to the hard work of the Oyu Tolgoi team, and despite the difficult environment created by COVID-19, we are on track to meet our production guidance for 2021. All technical undercut readiness activities to begin underground production have been completed and Oyu Tolgoi has been ready from a technical perspective to commence the undercut since <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2021</span>."" Stated <span class=""xn-person"">Steve Thibeault</span>, Interim Chief Executive Officer of Turquoise Hill Resources. ""While the COVID-19 situation in <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> is improving slightly, Oyu Tolgoi is maintaining rigorous anti-COVID protocols at site to ensure the health of our employees. Currently 100% of the Oyu Tolgoi workforce has been double vaccinated and a campaign to administer a third dose is advancing well."" <b>FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS</b><b>&nbsp;</b> <span class=""prnews_span"">___________________</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><sup>1 </sup>Please refer to Section – NON-GAAP MEASURES – on page 21 of this press release for further information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK FOR 2021</b> Oyu Tolgoi's copper and gold production guidance for 2021 remains within the ranges of 150,000 to 180,000 tonnes of copper and 400,000 to 480,000 ounces of gold, respectively. Operating cash costs<sup><sup>2</sup></sup>&nbsp;for 2021 are still expected to be within the range of <span class=""xn-money"">$800 million</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$850 million</span>.  Capital expenditure for 2021 on a cash-basis has been reduced to <span class=""xn-money"">$80 million</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$100 million</span> from <span class=""xn-money"">$105 million</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$125 million</span> for the open-pit and to <span class=""xn-money"">$0.8 billion</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$0.9 billion</span> from <span class=""xn-money"">$0.9 billion</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$1.0 billion</span> for the underground, including underground sustaining capital expenditure, caused mainly by the impact of the delayed undercut commencement and the on-going impacts of on-site COVID-19 restrictions. Open pit capital is mainly comprised of deferred stripping, equipment purchases, tailings storage facility construction and maintenance componentization. Underground capital is inclusive of VAT.  2021 C1 cash costs<sup><sup>2</sup></sup>&nbsp;are expected to be in the range of negative <span class=""xn-money"">$0.20</span> to positive <span class=""xn-money"">$0.20</span> per pound of copper produced. Unit cost guidance assumes the midpoint of the expected 2021 copper and gold production ranges and a gold price of <span class=""xn-money"">$1,804</span> per ounce.  <span class=""prnews_span"">___________________</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Please refer to Section – NON-GAAP MEASURES – on page 21 of this press release for further information&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <b>OUR BUSINESS</b><b>&nbsp;</b> Turquoise Hill is an international mining company focused on the operation and continued development of the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine in <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>, which is the Company's principal and only material mineral resource property. The Company's ownership of the Oyu Tolgoi mine is held through a 66% interest in OT LLC; the remaining 34% interest is held by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (Erdenes), a Mongolian state-owned entity.  The Oyu Tolgoi property is located approximately 550 kilometres south of Ulaanbaatar, <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia's</span> capital city, and 80 kilometres north of the <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>-<span class=""xn-location"">China</span> border. The property is cut by the Oyu Tolgoi trend, a 12 kilometres north-south orientated corridor which is host to the known deposits, Hugo North, <span class=""xn-person"">Hugo South</span>, Oyut and Heruga. Open pit mining operations commenced at Oyut in 2013. The Hugo North deposit (Lift 1) is currently being developed as an underground operation. The copper concentrator plant, with related facilities and necessary infrastructure, was originally designed to process approximately 100,000 tonnes of ore per day from the Oyut open-pit. However, since 2014, the concentrator has consistently achieved a throughput of over 105,000 tonnes per day due to improvements in operating practices. Concentrator throughput for 2021 is targeted at over 110,000 tonnes per day and expected to be approximately 40 million tonnes for the year due to improvements in concentrator performance and more favourable ore characteristics. At the end of Q3'21, Oyu Tolgoi had a total workforce (employees and contractors), including for underground project construction, of approximately 14,000 workers, of which over 96% were Mongolian. <b>SELECTED FINANCIAL METRICS</b><b>&nbsp;<sup>(1)&nbsp;</sup></b>&nbsp;

During Q3'21, <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> continued to experience a significant number of COVID-19 cases, which continued to limit the ability of Oyu Tolgoi to maintain normal roster changes for its workers. While Oyu Tolgoi did experience an improvement in on-site personnel numbers vs Q2'21, average workforce numbers remained below 50% of planned requirements during Q3'21.  COVID-19 restrictions have adversely impacted both open-pit operations and underground development, which, through the end of Q3'21 and as announced on <span class=""xn-chron"">October 14, 2021</span>, have resulted in a cumulative increase of <span class=""xn-money"">$140 million</span> to the estimate of underground development capital included in the Definitive Estimate. This increase includes the currently known, incremental and time-related costs of COVID-19 restrictions through <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30,2021</span>; however, it does not include any impacts arising from associated schedule delays or delayed commitments caused by the Definitive Estimate not yet having received the support of all the directors of the OT LLC Board, as these are still under assessment. The Company will continue to monitor these costs and will update the market as appropriate. All workers at the Oyu Tolgoi site have had two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, and a third dose program is well advanced. Improvements in quarantine protocols both on-site and off-site have resulted in a relaxation of restrictions, which resulted in higher workforce numbers in <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2021</span> while still minimising the spread of COVID-19. A return to normal workforce levels is expected by the end of 2021, and Oyu Tolgoi will continue to cooperate with the Mongolian authorities to implement and maintain control measures to protect the health and well-being of its workers as well as the local community. <b>Selected Operational Metrics</b> <b>Oyu Tolgoi Production Data <br class=""dnr""></b><i>All data represents full production and

class=""prnews_span"">18.5%</span> In Q3'21, both copper and gold production from the open-pit were higher vs Q3'20 due mainly to mining higher grade material from Phase <span class=""xn-money"">4B</span>. Mill throughput of 9.34 million tonnes in Q3'21 was in line with Q2'21 and 7% lower than Q3'20. Processing of harder ore as well as lower SAG mill availability, due to maintenance, impacted Q3'21 mill throughput. Oyu Tolgoi provided an updated mine plan reflecting the impacts of the mine redesign in response to previously disclosed open-pit geotechnical events, which is currently forecast to result in deferral of some open-pit metal to beyond 2024. In addition, the on-going impacts of on-site COVID-19 restrictions, have resulted in delayed waste movement thereby impacting short term operations. While opportunities to reduce the impact of this forecast metal deferral are under consideration, related work is not expected to be completed until H1'22. <b>Oyu Tolgoi Underground Update</b> All technical undercut readiness activities have been completed, and Oyu Tolgoi has been ready from a technical perspective to commence the undercut since <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2021</span>. Undercut commencement remains delayed and is pending resolution of certain non-technical undercut criteria, including the support of all OT LLC Board Directors to increase the underground development capital investment&nbsp;and to commence discussions with the project finance lenders, obtaining outstanding required regulatory approvals and agreeing on a pathway to meet OT LLC's long-term power requirements, all of which are critical elements for consideration to proceed with the decision to commence the undercut and remain the subject of ongoing discussions. During Q3'21, underground development progress continued to be significantly impacted by COVID-19 constraints on-site and in <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>, including restrictions on movement of both domestic and international expertise. Despite these constraints, breakthrough of the conveyor decline was achieved in <span class=""xn-chron"">August 2021</span>, sinking of Shaft 4 recommenced in <span class=""xn-chron"">mid-October 2021</span>, and preparatory work for Shaft 3 sinking continued. Breakthrough of the service decline is forecast in November 2021.&nbsp;  MHS1 construction is almost complete with no-load commissioning commencing in Q3'21 and is currently expected to be completed by the end of <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2022</span>. Construction of the first on-footprint truck chute is well advanced and currently forecast to be completed by February 2022.&nbsp; Completion of both MHS1 and the first on-footprint truck chute is broadly in-line with the Definitive Estimate, a positive result given the challenging circumstances. Nevertheless, given the cumulative and on-going impacts of COVID-19, continued delayed commitments from the Definitive Estimate not yet having received the support of all directors of the OT LLC Board, as well as the outstanding unresolved non-technical undercut issues, the Company now expects sustainable production for Panel 0 to be delayed to H1'23, broadly in line with the current forecast 6-month delay to undercut commencement.&nbsp;  Progress on Shafts 3 and 4 has been impacted by quarantine requirements and international travel restrictions related to COVID-19. As a result, no significant development progress on these shafts was made during Q3'21. Consequently, OT LLC has advised that a 9-month delay on Shafts 3 and 4 is currently forecast which, in combination with a COVID- related reduction in underground development progress as well as expected changes to mining scope, is currently forecast to delay the initiation of Panel 2 by approximately 14 – 16 months compared to the Definitive Estimate. Panel 1 is currently forecast to be impacted to a lesser extent with an approximate commencement 11 months later than the Definitive Estimate. These delays are expected to extend the ramp up to 95,000 tpd by a similar timeframe. Efforts to minimize the delays to Panel 1 and Panel 2 due to ventilation constraints ahead of Shaft 3 and 4 commissioning continue As at the end of Q3'21, cumulative* underground development progress was 60,085 equivalent metres (eqm) and cumulative* Conveyor to Surface advancement was 15,174 eqm. It is anticipated that development rates will continue to be impacted into Q4'21. <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Oyu Tolgoi Underground Project Development Progress Excluding Conveyor

rounding.</span> The Company continues to engage Rio Tinto and various Mongolian governmental bodies to resolve the remaining outstanding non-technical undercut criteria, and remains committed to moving the project forward and ensuring long-term and mutually beneficial solutions to the issues under discussion. Rio Tinto and the Company have recently tabled a proposal to the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>, which the Company believes addresses all of the major outstanding issues while ensuring that OT LLC will continue to deliver compelling value to all partners. By way of examples, certain items contained in the overall proposed package that the Company is willing to discuss include proposals to reduce a portion of the debt currently owing by Erdenes and to accelerate or increase the anticipated returns to Erdenes and the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>. Nevertheless, delayed resolution of outstanding issues, as well as the slowing of discussions as a result of the COVID-19 situation in <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>, will delay the Company's expected timing for initiation of the undercut. Due to the delays of the approval of the Definitive Estimate and necessary additional investment by the OT LLC Board, some contractual commitments for future works on items such as Material Handling System 2 and the Concentrator upgrade have experienced delays, and are expected to impact the overall project duration, which will have ongoing cost implications. Any significant further delay to the initiation of the undercut would result in further, unfavourable impacts to the underground project schedule, including the timing of sustainable production for Panel 0, the timing to commence Panel 2 and the timing and quantum of underground capital expenditure, all of which would materially, adversely impact the timing of expected cash flows from the Oyu Tolgoi underground project thereby further increasing the quantum of Turquoise Hill's estimated incremental funding requirement and would also, in turn, adversely affect the ability of the Company and OT LLC to obtain additional funding or r-profile existing debt as contemplated within the timeframe set out in the Heads of Agreement entered into between the Company and Rio Tinto in <span class=""xn-chron"">April 2021</span> (""HoA""). See the section of this press release titled ""Funding of OT LLC by Turquoise Hill"".&nbsp; The Definitive Estimate, which was completed in <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2020</span>, forecast first sustainable production in <span class=""xn-chron"">October 2022</span> and estimated a development capital cost of <span class=""xn-money"">$6.75 billion</span>. It assumed COVID-19 related restrictions in 2021 would be no more stringent than those experienced in <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2020</span>. As actual 2021 COVID-19 restrictions have been and are expected to be, for a period of time, more stringent than those assumed in the Definitive Estimate, a reassessment is underway to consider potential impacts thereof on the underground development capital estimate as well as the overall project schedule. The additional 2021 development cost impact of the known COVID-19 delays up to <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> is estimated to be approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$140 million</span>, and additional impacts are expected as COVID-19 restrictions persist into Q4'21. The Company continues to monitor the impacts associated with COVID-19 delays as well as the time to resolve the non-technical undercut and other issues on the underground development capital estimate as well as the overall project schedule.  Given the cumulative and on-going impacts of COVID-19, continued delayed commitments resulting from the Definitive Estimate not yet having received the support of all directors of the OT LLC Board, as well as the outstanding non-technical undercut issues, the Company now expects sustainable production for Panel 0 to be delayed to H1'23, broadly in line with the current&nbsp;forecast 6-month&nbsp;delay to undercut commencement. OT LLC spent <span class=""xn-money"">$200.6 million</span> on underground capital during Q3'21, including <span class=""xn-money"">$63.7 million</span> of underground sustaining capital. Total underground project spend from <span class=""xn-chron"">January 1, 2016</span>, to <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, was approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$5.1 billion</span>, including <span class=""xn-money"">$0.3 billion</span> of underground sustaining capital. Underground project spend on a cash basis includes VAT and capitalised management services payments but excludes capitalised interest. In addition, OT LLC had contractual obligations7 of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.4 billion</span> as at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>. Since the restart of project development in 2016 through <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, Oyu Tolgoi has committed over <span class=""xn-money"">$3.9 billion</span> to Mongolian vendors and contractors. Given the total underground development spend of <span class=""xn-money"">$4.8 billion</span> and contractual obligations of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.4 billion</span> as at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, Oyu Tolgoi is expected to reach the total <span class=""xn-money"">$5.3 billion</span> underground development (actual spend plus contractual obligations) as stated in the original 2016 feasibility study, during <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2021</span>. In the event that the necessary additional investment to progress underground development is not supported by all directors of the OT LLC board by the end of <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2021</span>, OT LLC will be at risk of having to slow down further work on the underground development. <span class=""prnews_span"">____________________</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><sup>4 </sup>Please refer to Section – NON-GAAP MEASURES – on page 21 of this press release for further information.</span> <b>Incremental Mine Design Refinements</b> Panel 1 and Panel 2 are the focus of additional study work, which will continue through to 2023. The study work includes: To support these studies, additional data is being collected from surface and underground drilling. This data is used to refine the structural and geotechnical models, which form the basis of the mine design. Although the drilling has been hampered by COVID-19 cases and restrictions on people movements, the study work remains broadly on schedule.&nbsp;  Results from the Panel 2 study are expected in H1'22. The scope of this study includes a review of the base case, including optimisation of the panel orientation and the undercut strategy. The initial focus is on the northern section of Panel 2 (where additional data is already available) and will be expanded to include the southern section in the latter part of 2022.  The Panel 1 and Pillar Recovery studies are scheduled for completion in early 2023.&nbsp;  <b>Force Majeure</b> OT LLC concentrate shipment volumes to customers improved during Q3'21; however, above target inventory levels remained at the end of Q3'21 as a result of the COVID-19 related Mongolian / Chinese border restrictions that resulted in force majeure being declared <span class=""xn-chron"">March 30, 2021</span>. Shipments to Chinese customers recommenced on <span class=""xn-chron"">April 15, 2021</span>, and OT LLC continues to work closely with Mongolian and Chinese authorities to manage any supply chain disruptions and is temporarily increasing its capacity to move concentrate through the use of double trailer trucks and other measures. The force majeure will remain in place until there are sufficiently sustained volumes of convoys crossing the border to ensure OT LLC's ability to meet its ongoing commitments to customers and to return on-site concentrate inventory to target levels. <b>FUNDING OF OT LLC BY TURQUOISE HILL</b> In accordance with the Amended and Restated Shareholders' Agreement dated <span class=""xn-chron"">June 8, 2011</span> (ARSHA), Turquoise Hill has funded OT LLC's cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt. For amounts funded by debt, OT LLC must repay such amounts, including accrued interest, before it can pay common share dividends. As at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the Company to OT LLC was <span class=""xn-money"">$8.0 billion</span>, including accrued interest of <span class=""xn-money"">$2.1 billion</span>. These loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5%.  In accordance with the ARSHA, a subsidiary of the Company has funded the common share investments in OT LLC on behalf of state-owned Erdenes. These funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable, by Erdenes to a subsidiary of the Company, via a pledge over Erdenes' share of OT LLC common share dividends. Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time. As at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, the cumulative amount of such funding was <span class=""xn-money"">$1.4 billion</span>, representing 34% of invested common share equity, with unrecognised interest on the amounts funded of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.9 billion</span>. As at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, Turquoise Hill has <span class=""xn-money"">$0.8 billion</span> of available liquidity, which under current projections is expected to be sufficient to meet the requirements of the Company, including its operations and underground development, into Q3'22. Short-term cash forecasts have been prepared which also incrementally incorporate the plans that the Company has in place to access additional sources of funding as contemplated in the HoA which then enables the Company to access sufficient liquidity to meet its minimum obligations for a period of at least 12 months from the balance sheet date. At the time it was signed, the HoA provided an updated funding plan (the Funding Plan) for the completion of the OT LLC underground project in <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>. The Funding Plan was designed to address the estimated remaining funding requirement at that time and replace the non-binding Memorandum of Understanding that Rio Tinto and Turquoise Hill previously entered into on <span class=""xn-chron"">September 9, 2020</span>. Under the HoA, subject to securing approval by the OT LLC Board and any required support from the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>, Turquoise Hill and Rio Tinto will:  In addition, Rio Tinto has committed to address any potential shortfalls from the re-profiling and additional SSD of up to <span class=""xn-money"">$750 million</span> by providing a senior co-lending facility (the Co-Lending Facility) on the same terms as Oyu Tolgoi's project financing, while Turquoise Hill has committed to complete an equity offering of common shares for up to <span class=""xn-money"">$500 million</span> in the form of, and at Turquoise Hill's discretion, either (i) a rights offering, or (ii) a public offering or private placement of common shares, in either case sufficient to satisfy any remaining funding shortfall of up to <span class=""xn-money"">$500 million</span> within six months of the Co-Lending Facility becoming available. The requirement of Rio Tinto to advance funds under the Co-Lending facility is subject to a number of conditions precedent set out in the HoA (a copy of which is available on the Company's SEDAR and EDGAR profiles), including, among others: that certain undertakings provided by the Company in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi project finance lenders be amended to cover the Co-Lending Facility; that terms of the Oyu Tolgoi project finance agreements with respect to a ""Sponsor Senior Loan"" not be amended in any material respect; the absence of new material claims and proceedings against Turquoise Hill or Rio Tinto that could adversely impact the funding elements of the HoA; the absence of a material adverse change and of a ""Suspensive Event"" as defined under the Oyu Tolgoi project finance agreements, and operations at Oyu Tolgoi not having been suspended for certain defined periods of time; all relevant third party approvals and consents having been obtained; and the board of directors of OT LLC and its Technical Committee having approved the undercut decision. The foregoing list of conditions does not purport to be exhaustive, and investors should refer to a copy of the HoA as filed on the SEDAR and EDGAR profiles of the Company.&nbsp;  To address the residual funding requirement after implementing the Funding Plan under the HOA, the Company will, at the appropriate times, consider all funding options available to it. Such options may include additional debt from banks or international financial institutions, an offering of global medium-term notes, a gold pre-sale transaction, a gold streaming transaction and additional equity. Successful implementation of the HoA is subject to achieving alignment with the relevant stakeholders in addition to Rio Tinto (including existing lenders, any potential new lenders and the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>), market conditions and other factors. However, as described above, any significant further delays to the initiation of the undercut, or non-fulfillment of any of the other conditions precedent identified jn the HoA. would also adversely affect the ability of the Company and OT LLC to obtain additional funding or re-profile existing debt as contemplated within the timeframe set out in the HoA. The Company is in discussions with Rio Tinto regarding implementation of the HoA as well as its residual funding requirements. In addition, given the uncertainties outlined above, the Company is currently assessing alternatives in the event that the timeline as outlined in the HoA is not achieved.  Turquoise Hill's liquidity outlook will continue to be impacted, either positively or negatively, by various factors, many of which are outside the Company's control, including:  Turquoise Hill continues to monitor its liquidity outlook and will provide updates as and when circumstances require. <br class=""dnr"">Turquoise Hill currently estimates its base case incremental funding requirement to be <span class=""xn-money"">$3.6 billion</span> (<span class=""xn-chron"">30 June 2021</span>: <span class=""xn-money"">$2.4 billion</span>), taking into consideration: The increase in base case incremental funding reflects preliminary information provided by OT LLC primarily regarding the delay to the initiation of the undercut. Additionally, Turquoise Hill currently estimates its base case incremental funding will continue to be influenced by various factors over the incremental funding period, many of which are outside the Company's control, including: More generally, any changes in the above factors will impact the incremental funding requirement and, as a result, the actual quantum of incremental funding required may be greater or less than the <span class=""xn-money"">$3.6 billion</span> base case estimate, and such variance may be significant. As a result of the project delays and the increase to the Company's base case estimated incremental funding requirement disclosed above in this press release and initially announced on <span class=""xn-chron"">October 14, 2021</span>, and given the conditions precedent to availability of the various sources of funding available under the HoA, there is currently significant uncertainty regarding the ability of the Company and OT LLC to carry out, within the timeframe set out in the HoA, the re-profiling of existing debt, to obtain additional SSD or additional funding, or the process to access funds under the Co-Lending Facility. The Company is currently in discussions with Rio Tinto to consider the potential adjustments to be made to the timeframe and terms and conditions set out in the HoA to address near term funding risks and will update the market as appropriate.  <b>GOVERNMENT RELATIONS</b><b>&nbsp;</b> Turquoise Hill's ownership of the Oyu Tolgoi mine is held through a 66% interest in OT LLC. The remaining 34% interest in OT LLC is held by Erdenes. Turquoise Hill is obliged to fund Erdenes' share of the capital costs under the ARSHA. Underground construction recommenced in <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2016</span> when OT LLC received the final requirement for the restart of underground development: formal notice to proceed approval by the boards of Turquoise Hill, Rio Tinto (as project manager) and OT LLC. Approval followed the signing of the Oyu Tolgoi Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan (UDP) in <span class=""xn-chron"">May 2015</span> and the signing of a <span class=""xn-money"">$4.4 billion</span> project finance facility in <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2015</span>. Development had been suspended in <span class=""xn-chron"">August 2013</span> pending resolution of matters with the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>. Turquoise Hill's investment in the Oyu Tolgoi mine is governed by the 2009 Investment Agreement among Turquoise Hill, the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>, OT LLC and an affiliate of Rio Tinto (Investment Agreement or IA). The Investment Agreement framework was authorised by the Mongolian Parliament and was concluded after 16 months of negotiations. It was reviewed by numerous constituencies within the Government. Turquoise Hill has been operating in good faith under the terms of the Investment Agreement since 2009, and we believe not only that it is a valid and binding agreement, but that it has proven to be beneficial for all parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Adherence to the principles of the Investment Agreement, the ARSHA and the UDP has allowed for the development of the Oyu Tolgoi mine in a manner that has given rise to significant long-term benefits to <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>. Benefits from the Oyu Tolgoi mine open-pit operations and underground development include, but are not limited to, employment, royalties and taxes, local procurement, economic development and sustainability investments. As previously announced by the Company on <span class=""xn-chron"">January 11, 2021</span>, the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> has expressed concern with the results of the Definitive Estimate, which was completed and delivered by Rio Tinto and publicly announced by the Company on <span class=""xn-chron"">December 18, 2020</span> and is concerned that the significant increase in the development costs of the Oyu Tolgoi project has eroded the economic benefits it anticipated to receive therefrom. The Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> has indicated that if the Oyu Tolgoi project is not economically beneficial to the country, it would be necessary to review and evaluate whether it can proceed. The Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> has stressed the importance of achieving a comprehensive solution that addresses both financial issues between the shareholders of OT LLC as well as economic and social issues of importance to <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>, such as water usage, tax payments, and social issues related to employees, in order to implement the Oyu Tolgoi project successfully. In particular, the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> has expressed its intention to initiate discussions with respect to the termination and replacement of the UDP. While acknowledging Oyu Tolgoi's significant contributions to <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>, Turquoise Hill continues to engage with the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> and remains open to improving the UDP to deliver even greater benefits from Oyu Tolgoi to all stakeholders.  In Q1'20, OT LLC submitted a mineral resources and reserves update for registration with the Mongolian Minerals Council as required pursuant to local regulatory requirements in <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>. In <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2021</span>, the updated Resources and Reserves (RR19) was approved by the Minerals Council of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>, and the updated Feasibility Study (OTFS20) will be able to be submitted for assessment once the RR19 registration process progresses further.  <b>Oyu Tolgoi Special Committee Independent Consulting Group Report</b> As announced on <span class=""xn-chron"">December 1, 2020</span>, the board of directors of OT LLC established a special board committee (the ""OT Special Committee"") comprised of two representatives of Erdenes and two representatives of the Company to investigate the causes of the increase in cost and schedule extension to the underground development of the Oyu Tolgoi project during the period between the 2016 Feasibility Study and the <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2020</span> Definitive Estimate.  A group of consultants called ""The Independent Consulting Group"" (""ICG"") was hired to conduct the review on behalf of the OT Special Committee. ICG submitted its report to the OT Special Committee on <span class=""xn-chron"">August 3, 2021</span> (the ""ICG Report""). The ICG Report raises certain questions in relation to the project management process surrounding the increase in cost and schedule extension and suggests that changes in geotechnical parameters did not contribute significantly thereto. The OT Board and the Company are conducting a detailed review of the ICG Report and will seek a number of clarifications and supporting detailed explanations for certain of the broad conclusions it contains. The Company will update the market as appropriate. <b>Negotiations with the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> </b> Turquoise Hill continues to engage Rio Tinto and various Mongolian governmental bodies to resolve the remaining outstanding non-technical undercut criteria, and the Company remains committed to moving the project forward and ensuring long-term and mutually beneficial solutions to the issues under discussion. Nevertheless, delayed resolution of outstanding issues, as well as the slowing of discussions as a result of the COVID-19 situation in <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>, will delay the Company's expected timing for initiation of the undercut. Due to the delays of the approval of the Definitive Estimate and necessary additional investment by the OT LLC Board, some contractual commitments for future works on items such as Material Handling System 2 and the Concentrator upgrade have experienced delays, and are expected to impact the overall project duration, which will have ongoing cost implications. Any significant further delay to the initiation of the undercut would result in further, unfavourable impacts to the underground project schedule, including the timing of sustainable production for Panel 0, the timing to commence Panel 2 and the timing and quantum of underground capital expenditure, all of which would materially, adversely impact the timing of expected cash flows from the Oyu Tolgoi underground project thereby further increasing the quantum of Turquoise Hill's estimated incremental funding requirement and would also likely in turn adversely affect the ability of the Company and Oyu Tolgoi to obtain additional funding or re-profile existing debt as contemplated&nbsp; within the timeframe set out in the HoA entered into between the Company and Rio Tinto in <span class=""xn-chron"">April 2021</span>. In the event that the necessary additional investment to progress underground development is not supported by all directors of the OT LLC board by the end of <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2021</span>, OT LLC will be at risk of having to slow down further work on the underground development.  Turquoise Hill remains committed to seeking resolution of outstanding issues and remains mobilized in <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> to continue discussions with the Government to progress timely resolution for the benefit of all stakeholders. Company representatives have spent almost 3 months in country since March working to resolve issues constructively. Rio Tinto and the Company have recently tabled a proposal to the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>, which the Company believes addresses all of the major outstanding issues while ensuring that OT LLC will continue to deliver compelling value to all partners. By way of examples, certain items contained in the overall proposed package that the Company is willing to discuss include proposals to reduce a portion of the debt currently owing by Erdenes and to accelerate or increase the anticipated returns to Erdenes and the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>. The Company will continue to monitor the situation, assess any impact of any related delays and update the market as appropriate. <b>Oyu Tolgoi Mine Power Supply </b> OT LLC currently sources power for the Oyu Tolgoi mine from <span class=""xn-location"">China's</span> Inner Mongolian Western Grid, via overhead power line, pursuant to back-to-back power purchase arrangements with <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia's</span> National Power Transmission Grid JSC, the relevant Mongolian power authority, and Inner Mongolia Power International Cooperation Co., Ltd (IMPIC), the subsidiary of Inner Mongolia's power grid company.  OT LLC is obliged under the Investment Agreement to secure a long-term domestic source of power for the Oyu Tolgoi mine. The PSFA provides a binding framework and pathway for long-term power supply to the Oyu Tolgoi mine. The PSFA originally contemplated the construction of a coal-fired power plant at Tavan Tolgoi (TTPP), which would be majority-owned by OT LLC and situated close to the Tavan Tolgoi coal mining district located approximately 150 kilometres from the Oyu Tolgoi mine. In <span class=""xn-chron"">April 2020</span>, the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> advised that it was unwilling to support OT LLC's proposal to develop TTPP and announced its intention to supply power to Oyu Tolgoi from a Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> funded, owned and operated power plant at Tavan Tolgoi (SOPP).&nbsp;&nbsp; In <span class=""xn-chron"">June 2020</span>, OT LLC and the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> entered into the PSFA Amendment to reflect their agreement to jointly prioritise and progress SOPP, in accordance with and subject to agreed milestones, as the domestic source of power for the Oyu Tolgoi mine. The milestones included: signing a power purchase agreement (SOPP PPA) for the supply of power to the Oyu Tolgoi mine by <span class=""xn-chron"">March 31, 2021</span>, commencing construction of SOPP by no later than <span class=""xn-chron"">July 1, 2021</span>, commissioning SOPP within four years thereafter, and reaching agreement with IMPIC on an extension to the existing power import arrangements by <span class=""xn-chron"">March 1, 2021</span> in order to ensure there is no disruption to the power supply required to safeguard the Oyu Tolgoi mine's ongoing operations and development.  The PSFA Amendment provides that if certain agreed milestones are not met in a timely manner (subject to extension for Delay Events as defined) then OT LLC will be entitled to select from, and implement, the alternative power solutions specified in the PSFA Amendment, including a coal-fired power plant at Oyu Tolgoi, the Mongolian grid or a primary renewables solution, and the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> would be obliged to support such decision.&nbsp; Three PSFA Amendment milestones (execution of the extension of the IMPIC supply arrangements, execution of the SOPP PPA, and start of SOPP construction) were not met by the original dates of March 1,&nbsp;2021, March 31,&nbsp;2021,&nbsp;and <span class=""xn-chron"">July 1, 2021</span>, respectively. The Ministry of Energy formally notified Rio Tinto and OT LLC on <span class=""xn-chron"">February 25, 2021</span> that the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia's</span> preference is to supply power to the Oyu Tolgoi mine from the Central Energy System through a Mongolian grid Electricity Supply Agreement (ESA). Rio Tinto and OT LLC have expressed willingness to consider Mongolian grid supply provided certain key conditions can be met, including the National Power Transmission Grid (NPTG) securing a suitable extension of the power import arrangements with IMPIC to ensure certainty of power supply to Oyu Tolgoi until such time as the Mongolian grid is able to deliver stable and reliable power to Oyu Tolgoi over the long term. OT LLC continues to collaborate with the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> to ensure a secure, stable and reliable long-term power solution is implemented with an immediate focus on negotiating the ESA as well as extending the IMPIC supply arrangements prior to the commencement of the undercut. <b>Oyu Tolgoi Tax Assessments&nbsp;</b> On <span class=""xn-chron"">January 16, 2018</span>, Turquoise Hill announced that OT LLC had received and was evaluating a tax assessment for approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$155 million</span> (which was converted from Mongolian Tugrik to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on that date)&nbsp;from the Mongolian Tax Authority (MTA) relating to an audit on taxes imposed and paid by OT LLC between 2013 and 2015 (the 2013 to 2015 Tax Assessment). In <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2018</span>, OT LLC paid an amount of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$4.8 million</span> to settle unpaid taxes, fines and penalties for accepted items. On <span class=""xn-chron"">February 20, 2020</span>, the Company announced that OT LLC would be proceeding with the initiation of a formal international arbitration proceeding in accordance with dispute resolution provisions within Chapter 14 of the Investment Agreement and Chapter 8 of the UDP. The dispute resolution provisions call for arbitration under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) seated in <span class=""xn-location"">London</span> before a panel of three arbitrators. By agreeing to resolve certain matters within the 2013 to 2015 Tax Assessment dispute under UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, both parties have agreed that the arbitral award shall be final and binding on both parties and the parties shall carry out the award without delay. On <span class=""xn-chron"">December 23, 2020</span>, Turquoise Hill announced that OT LLC had received and was evaluating a tax assessment for approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$228 million</span> (which was converted from Mongolian Tugrik to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on that date) from the MTA relating to an audit on taxes imposed and paid by OT LLC between 2016 and 2018 (the 2016 to 2018 Tax Assessment). Most of the matters raised in respect of the 2016 to 2018 Tax Assessment are of a similar nature to the matters that were raised in the 2013 to 2015 Tax Assessment. The MTA also proposed a <span class=""xn-money"">$1.4 billion</span> adjustment to the balance of OT LLC's carried forward tax losses. The adjustments are to disallow or defer certain tax deductions claimed in the 2016 to 2018 years.  On <span class=""xn-chron"">January 11, 2021</span>, Turquoise Hill announced that OT LLC had completed its evaluation of the 2016 to 2018 Tax Assessment claim and confirmed that OT LLC had given notice of its intention to apply to the UNCITRAL tribunal to amend its statement of claim to include certain matters raised in the 2016 to 2018 Tax Assessment. OT LLC's application to include these matters in the pending arbitration for the 2013 to 2015 Tax Assessment was accepted. In addition to those matters included within the statement of claim, there are certain limited tax matters included in the 2013 to 2015 and 2016 to 2018 Tax Assessments, which are being addressed in local Mongolian tax courts. As there is less certainty with respect to the resolution of these matters, the Company has accrued for certain amounts and has also adjusted its loss carry forwards. In <span class=""xn-chron"">February 2021</span>, Oyu Tolgoi received notices of payment totalling approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$228 million</span> (which were converted from Mongolian Tugrik to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on those dates) relating to amounts disputed under the 2016 to 2018 Tax Assessment, and in <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2021</span>, Oyu Tolgoi received notices of payment totalling <span class=""xn-money"">$126 million</span> (which were converted from Mongolian Tugrik to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on those dates) relating to amounts disputed under the 2013 to 2015 Tax Assessment. Under the Mongolian General Tax Law, the amounts were due and paid by OT LLC within 10 business days from the dates of the notices of payment. Under the same legislation, OT LLC would be entitled to recover the amounts, including via offset against future tax liabilities, in the event of a favourable decision from the relevant dispute resolution authorities. On <span class=""xn-chron"">May 3, 2021</span>, the Company announced that the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> filed its statement of defence together with a counterclaim (""GOM Defence and Counterclaim"") in relation to the tax arbitration proceeding. Turquoise Hill is not a party to the arbitration, but the GOM Defence and Counterclaim has requested that the arbitral tribunal add both the Company and a member of the Rio Tinto Group as parties to the tax arbitration. The principal thrust of the GOM Defence and Counterclaim is to seek the rejection of OT LLC's tax claims in their entirety. As part of the counterclaim, the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> also makes assertions surrounding previously reported allegations of historical improper payments made to Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> officials and seeks unquantified damages. Also, in the event OT LLC's tax claims are not dismissed in their entirety, the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> is seeking in the counterclaim an alternative declaration that the Investment Agreement is void.  The Company denies the allegations relating to the Company in the GOM Defence and Counterclaim and filed a submission to the arbitral tribunal to oppose the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia's</span> request that it be added to the tax arbitration. If nevertheless the Company is added to the arbitration proceedings, Turquoise Hill will vigorously defend itself against the counterclaim The Company remains of the opinion that the tax positions adopted by OT LLC in its tax filings were correct and that OT LLC has paid all taxes and charges required under the Investment Agreement, the ARSHA, the UDP and Mongolian law. <b>CLASS ACTION COMPLAINTS</b> In <span class=""xn-chron"">October 2020</span>, a class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of <span class=""xn-location"">New York</span> against the Company, certain of its current and former officers as well as Rio Tinto and certain of its officers. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misstatements and material omissions with respect to, among other things, the schedule, cost and progress to completion of the development of Oyu Tolgoi in violation of Section 10(b) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and Rule <span class=""xn-money"">10b</span>-5 thereunder.&nbsp;Under the schedule established by the court, a first amended complaint was filed on <span class=""xn-chron"">March 16, 2021</span>, and a second amended complaint was filed on <span class=""xn-chron"">September 16, 2021</span>. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint on <span class=""xn-chron"">October 19, 2021</span>. The Company believes that the complaint against it is without merit. In <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2021</span>, a proposed class action was initiated in the Superior Court in the District of <span class=""xn-location"">Montreal</span> against the Company and certain of its current and former officers. An amended complaint was filed on <span class=""xn-chron"">July 27, 2021</span> which did not substantially alter the claim. The claim alleges that the Company and its current and former officers named therein as defendants made material misstatements and material omissions with respect to, among other things, the schedule, cost and progress to completion of Oyu Tolgoi, in violation of, among other things, sections 225.8, 225.9 and 225.11 of the <i>Securities Act </i>(<span class=""xn-location"">Quebec</span>)<i>. </i>The Company believes that the complaint against it is without merit and is preparing to defend the application for leave and certification of the proceeding.  See the risk factor titled ""The Company may be subject to public allegations, regulatory investigations or litigation that could materially and adversely affect the Company's business"" in the ""Risk Factors"" section of the AIF.  <b>CORPORATE ACTIVITIES</b><b>&nbsp;</b> <b>Exploration </b> Turquoise Hill, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Asia Gold Mongolia LLC, Heruga Exploration LLC and SGLS LLC, operates an exploration program in <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> on licences that are not part of Oyu Tolgoi. Turquoise Hill owns three exploration licences: Bag and Od-2 in the Ömnögovi province and Khatavch in the Dornogovi province. Field work was initially planned for late Q2'21 but was delayed due to COVID-19 cases and restrictions on people movements in the country, including in the Ömnögovi and Dornogovi provinces. In Q3'21, Turquoise Hill was able to commence field work on all three of its licences with the support of local and state government authorities. To ensure the health and safety of the exploration team, contractors and the communities, Turquoise Hill limited its people interaction by conducting all field work from site-based camps.&nbsp; At Bag and Od-2, the team finished the 2020 geophysics program, which had been delayed due to COVID-19 restrictions. On the Khatavch lease, the team commenced work on various geological surveys including mapping, sampling, ground gravity and topography as well as magnetics. During Q3'21, Turquoise Hill donated COVID-19 rapid tests to Khanbogd Soum (Bag and Od-2 licenses) and Mandakh soum (Khatavch). Both donations were well received and have enabled systematic COVID-19 testing in these soums. <b>NON-GAAP MEASURES</b><b>&nbsp;</b> The Company presents and refers to the following non-GAAP measures, which are not defined in IFRS. A description and calculation of each measure is given below and may differ from similarly named measures provided by other issuers. These measures are presented in order to provide investors and other stakeholders with additional understanding of performance and operations at the Oyu Tolgoi mine and are not intended to be used in isolation from, or as a replacement for, measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. <b>Operating cash costs</b> The measure of operating cash costs excludes: depreciation and depletion; exploration and evaluation; charges for asset write-down (including write-down of materials and supplies inventory) and includes management services payments to Rio Tinto and management services payments to Turquoise Hill, which are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. <b>C1 cash costs</b> C1 cash costs is a metric representing the cash cost per unit of extracting and processing the Company's principal metal product, copper, to a condition in which it may be delivered to customers net of gold and silver credits from concentrates sold. This metric is provided in order to support peer group comparability and to provide investors and other stakeholders with additional information about the underlying cash costs of OT LLC and the impact of gold and silver credits on the operations' cost structure. C1 cash costs are relevant to understanding the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When calculating costs associated with producing a pound of copper, the Company deducts gold and silver revenue credits as the production cost is reduced by selling these products. <b>All-in sustaining costs</b> All-in sustaining costs (AISC) is an extended cash-based cost metric providing further information on the aggregate cash, capital and overhead outlay per unit and is intended to reflect the costs of producing the Company's principal metal product, copper, in both the short term and over the life-cycle of its operations. As a result, sustaining capital expenditure on a cash basis is included rather than depreciation.

Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements and information, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. All such forward-looking statements and information are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company's management in light of their experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors management believes are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances. These statements, however, are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements or information. <br class=""dnr""> With respect to specific forward-looking information concerning the continued operation and development of Oyu Tolgoi, the Company has based its assumptions and analyses on certain factors which are inherently uncertain. Uncertainties and assumptions include, among others: the timing and cost of the construction and expansion of mining and processing facilities; the timing and availability of a long-term domestic power source (or the availability of financing for the Company or the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> to construct such a source) for Oyu Tolgoi; the implementation and successful execution of the funding plan that is the subject of the HoA and the amount of any additional future funding gap to complete the Oyu Tolgoi project as well as the amount and potential sources of additional funding required therefor, all as contemplated by the HoA; the status and nature of the Company's relationship, interactions and discussions with the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> on the continued operation and development of Oyu Tolgoi (including with respect to the causes of the increase in costs and schedule extension of the underground development) and OT LLC internal governance (including the outcome of any such interactions or discussions); the willingness and ability of the parties to the IA and the UDP to amend or replace either such agreement; the nature and quantum of the current and projected economic benefits to <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span> resulting from the continued operation of Oyu Tolgoi; the potential impact of COVID-19, including any restrictions imposed by health and governmental authorities relating thereto, as well as the development cost impacts of delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; the impact of changes in, changes in interpretation to or changes in enforcement of, laws, regulations and government practices in <span class=""xn-location"">Mongolia</span>; the availability and cost of skilled labour and transportation; the obtaining of (and the terms and timing of obtaining) necessary environmental and other government approvals, consents and permits; delays and the costs which would result from delays, including delays caused by COVID-19 restrictions and impacts and related factors, in the development of the underground mine (which could significantly exceed the costs projected in OTTR20); projected copper, gold and silver prices and their market demand; and production estimates and the anticipated yearly production of copper, gold and silver at Oyu Tolgoi. <br class=""dnr""> The cost, timing and complexities of mine construction and development are increased by the remote location of a property such as Oyu Tolgoi. It is common in mining operations and in the development or expansion of existing facilities to experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up. Additionally, although Oyu Tolgoi has achieved commercial production, there is no assurance that future development activities will result in profitable mining operations. <br class=""dnr""> Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information or statements.

 Commissioner's Authority to Order An Estimated $3.5 Billion in Refunds for Excessive Rates During Covid Called into Question News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 19:08 ET Share this article SAN DIEGO, Nov. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Insurance Commissioner cannot force insurance companies to repay consumers when they charge excessive rates, the state Court of Appeal in San Diego ruled late Friday afternoon.&nbsp; Rejecting the express language, purposes and intent of voter-approved Proposition 103 – and two previous decisions by the California Supreme Court – the court held that State Farm will not have to pay over $100 million in refunds plus interest to Californians who were overcharged by the company for its homeowners, condo and renters coverage. Also at stake as a result of this decision is an estimated $3.5&nbsp;<i>billion</i>&nbsp;in overcharges that insurance companies imposed on California motorists alone during the pandemic in 2020 that have not been repaid. The vast majority of insurers have failed to refund premiums that were collected based on rates that were set before the pandemic closed down the state's economy and left millions of cars in their driveways. Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara has repeatedly notified insurers that their rates and premiums were excessive and they must refund the overcharges. The court also held that when determining whether to approve a request by State Farm General, a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Farm Mutual, to raise its rates, the Insurance Commissioner cannot take into account the subsidiary's proportionate share of the investment income the company earns when it invests the funds of all its subsidiaries, including State Farm General. The ruling creates a loophole in California's comprehensive regulation of insurance rates—a loophole only available to large, multi-state companies that set up a separate California-only subsidiary like State Farm General, whose books the parent can cook to raise the rates to California consumers. Under the ruling, State Farm's customers will pay $100 million more for homeowners insurance every year from now on. ""Californians passed Proposition 103 to protect themselves against arbitrary rates and discriminatory practices by requiring insurance companies to keep rates and premiums fair at all times or else be held accountable by the Insurance Commissioner or in the courts,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, the author of Proposition 103. ""The Court of Appeal's decision has stripped the Insurance Commissioner of the powers the voters gave him to protect Californians against excessive rates. Consumer Watchdog will ask that it be overturned by the California Supreme Court."" <b>Decision Undermines Critical Proposition 103's Protections Against Insurance Company Profiteering</b>&nbsp; Under Proposition 103, enacted by California voters in 1988, insurance companies are barred from charging excessive auto, home and business rates. Companies are required to apply for and justify any rate changes before they take effect under a formula that limits their profits and expenses to fair levels. The law also requires companies to maintain existing rates at fair levels at all times. The measure authorizes consumers to challenge illegal rates and other insurance practices. In 2014, State Farm General applied for a 6.4% overall rate hike for its home, condo and renter insurance. Consumer Watchdog's experts analyzed the request, determined that it appeared excessive and asked the Insurance Commissioner to convene a public hearing. In November 2016, after a year-long public inquiry, Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones determined that the rate increase was unjustified and ordered the company to&nbsp;<i>reduce</i>&nbsp;its home insurance rates going forward by about $77 million per year. The Commissioner also concluded that the company had been overcharging its existing customers since July 2015 and ordered State Farm to&nbsp;<i>refund</i>&nbsp;over $100 million to California policyholders, with interest.&nbsp; State Farm then filed four separate lawsuits in San Diego Superior Court, seeking to overturn the Commissioner's decision on numerous grounds, including that the voter-enacted requirement that an insurance company open its books and justify its rates in a public hearing infringed on its constitutional rights. The court decision addresses two of State Farm's contentions. <u>Refund authority</u>: State Farm argued that the Insurance Commissioner has no authority to force an insurance company to refund overcharges.&nbsp; Consumer Watchdog and the Commissioner pointed out that California voters changed the law to place insurance companies doing business in California on notice that they must always maintain fair rates. Further, the California Supreme Court has twice unanimously upheld the authority of the Commissioner to order rate refunds and has stated that the voters gave the Commissioner full authority to carry out Proposition 103's protections. The Court of Appeal rejected these arguments. It imported into Proposition 103 a ""rule against retroactive rates"" that effectively repeals the voters' explicit directions and bars the Commissioner from requiring refunds. Consumer Watchdog said that the court's decision would create incentives for insurance companies to boost insurance rates unlawfully.&nbsp; <u>Investment Income</u>: Insurance companies make a large portion of their profits by investing the premiums consumers pay, and the regulations that govern insurance rates under Proposition 103 look at the insurer's entire investment income. The Commissioner and Consumer Watchdog argued that the formula protects Californians against attempts by an insurance company to hide its investment income, that the California Supreme Court had previously upheld the Commissioner's authority to do so, and that State Farm was not entitled to a special exemption from that regulation.&nbsp; But the Court of Appeal ruled that Proposition 103's requirement that the Commissioner consider whether insurance rates ""mathematically reflect the insurance company's investment income"" had to be read to allow State Farm Mutual (which had an after-tax profit of $4.6 billion in 2014) to create a wholly-owned subsidiary in California, stash its least profitable investments in that subsidiary, and ignore the California business' proportionate share of the portfolio profits – a bookkeeping trick that ignores the actual economics of the business. State Farm insured 20% of the homeowners market at the time. <b>Court Says Voters Intended to Protect&nbsp;<i>Insurance Companies</i></b> Consumer Watchdog said that the court's decision adopted the insurance industry's argument that the voters intended Proposition 103 to protect insurance companies. The court asserted that Proposition 103's ""focus"" was ""on fairness to both consumers and insurers,"" and said, ""We also are not persuaded by CW's argument that '[f]orcing consumers to pay excessive rates would frustrate the purpose of protecting consumers from arbitrary insurance rates.'"" The court also rejected the argument made by Consumer Watchdog and the Commissioner that allowing companies like State Farm to evade the rules on investment income would encourage them to create artificial subsidiaries for the purpose of rate manipulation. The court asserted: ""[Consumer Watchdog and the Commissioner] … do not establish that limiting rate manipulation was a purpose of Proposition 103.""&nbsp; Consumer Watchdog objected strongly to the court's interpretation of Proposition 103: ""The voters did not pass Proposition 103 to protect the insurance companies. They have enough money and lawyers to protect themselves. The text of the law makes clear its sole focus is to protect consumers against profiteering, discrimination, reckless insurance industry behavior and anything else that might harm consumers. The insurance industry would not have spent $63 million trying unsuccessfully to defeat Proposition 103 at the ballot box, and countless hundreds of millions more in legal challenges to the law since it passed, if the measure protected the industry's right to overcharge Californians, as the court suggests."" <b>Background on Proposition 103</b> State Farm's legal challenges are the latest in a three-decades long campaign by insurance companies to reverse the results of the 1988 election through litigation.&nbsp; Proposition 103 was approved by California voters in November 1988 after a David-versus-Goliath battle at the ballot box in which the insurance industry spent a record $63 million, and sponsored three competing initiatives, in an attempt to defeat the grassroots backed proposal.  The measure:<br class=""dnr"">• Mandated an immediate 20% rate rollback and refund;&nbsp;<br class=""dnr"">• Regulates auto, home and business insurance rates by requiring public disclosure and prior approval of rate changes;&nbsp;<br class=""dnr"">• Requires that auto premiums must be based primarily on a motorist's driving safety record rather than zip code;&nbsp;<br class=""dnr"">• Applies California's consumer protection, civil rights and antitrust&nbsp;laws to the insurance industry;&nbsp;<br class=""dnr"">• Authorizes consumers to challenge insurance company violations of the law through civil suits or an administrative hearings process; and,&nbsp;<br class=""dnr"">• Made the insurance commissioner an elected position. Insurance companies refunded over $1.43 billion to consumers after voters passed Proposition 103. The Consumer Federation of America has declared Prop 103 the most pro-consumer insurance law in the nation, estimating it has saved California motorists alone over $154 billion since it took effect in 1989.

The families are advocates for the Fairness for Injured Patients Act, an initiative on the <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2022</span> California ballot that would restore the rights of those harmed by medical negligence that were taken away by the legislature in 1975.  Families of medical negligence victims rarely have the opportunity to talk about how their loved ones lived, because they must share the tragedy of how they died in their quest for justice and accountability. <span class=""xn-person"">Dia de</span> los Muertos provides the chance to celebrate the people who are the reason the law must change.&nbsp;  ""It is not meant to be a day of mourning but a day of celebration.&nbsp; It is a day that we are displaying a offering of our love, our work, and our sacrifice in honor of our loved ones,"" stated Consumer Watchdog's Kathy Olsen Patient Advocate Michele Monserratt Ramos.&nbsp; ""We are showing our love and our pride for who our loved ones were.&nbsp; They are not just their tragic end but so much more.""

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 19:00 ET Share this article VANCOUVER,&nbsp;BC, November 2,&nbsp;2021 /PRNewswire/ - B2Gold Corp. (TSX: BTO) (NYSE AMERICAN: BTG) (NSX: B2G) (""B2Gold"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce its operational and financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021. The Company previously released its gold production and gold revenue results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021. All dollar figures are in <span class=""xn-location"">United States</span> dollars unless otherwise indicated. <b>2021 Third Quarter Highlights</b> <b>2021 First Nine Months Highlights</b> <b>Third Quarter and First Nine Months of 2021 Operational Results&nbsp;</b> Total gold production in the third quarter of 2021 was 310,261 ounces (including 14,538 ounces of attributable production from Calibre), above budget by 7% (20,871 ounces) and consolidated gold production from the Company's three operating mines was 295,723 ounces, above budget by 7% (20,083 ounces) with solid performances from the Company's three mines, with each mine exceeding its budgeted production for the third quarter of 2021 (see ""Operations"" section below). Both the Fekola and Otjikoto mines achieved record quarterly gold production in the third quarter of 2021. As planned, with increased throughput at the Fekola mill together with the completion of the significant waste stripping campaigns at both the Fekola and Otjikoto mines in the first half of 2021 (Phase 5 and Phase 6 of the Fekola Pit, and Phase 3 of the Wolfshag and Otjikoto pits), consolidated gold production in the third quarter of 2021 increased significantly by 19% (46,990 ounces) compared to the third quarter of 2020, as mining at Fekola reached the higher-grade zones of the Fekola Pit and mining at Otjikoto reached the higher-grade zone at the base of the Wolfshag Pit. Consolidated gold production also increased significantly by 50% (98,343 ounces) over the second quarter of 2021.  For the third quarter of 2021, total cash operating costs (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) were <span class=""xn-money"">$445</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$482</span> per ounce sold) and consolidated cash operating costs from the Company's three operating mines were <span class=""xn-money"">$418</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$456</span> per ounce sold), both approximately in-line with budget and comparable with the third quarter of 2020. In the third quarter of 2021, higher than budgeted gold production largely offset the impact of higher than budgeted realized fuel prices, processing costs and stronger local currencies, resulting in an overall cost per ounce which was approximately in-line with budget. Total AISC (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) for the third quarter of 2021 were <span class=""xn-money"">$795</span> per ounce sold and consolidated AISC from the Company's three operating mines were <span class=""xn-money"">$777</span> per ounce sold, both approximately in-line with budget (attributable to higher than budgeted gold ounces sold, higher than budgeted gains on settled fuel derivatives and lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures, largely offsetting higher than budgeted operating costs ) and comparable with the third quarter of 2020. The lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures were primarily the result of timing of expenditures and are expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the first nine months of 2021, total gold production was 742,517 ounces (including 43,771 ounces of attributable production from Calibre), above budget by 7% (49,682 ounces), and 4% (27,751 ounces) lower than the first nine months of 2020 due to the focus on waste stripping at Fekola and Otjikoto in the first half of 2021. Consolidated gold production from the Company's three operating mines was 698,746 ounces in the first nine months of 2021, above budget by 7% (47,161 ounces).  For the first nine months of 2021, total cash operating costs (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) were <span class=""xn-money"">$556</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$568</span> per ounce sold) and consolidated cash operating costs from the Company's three operating mines were <span class=""xn-money"">$532</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$544</span> per ounce sold), both approximately in-line with budget. As expected, the Company's consolidated cash operating costs were higher in the first nine months of 2021 compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$388</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$391</span> per ounce sold) in the first nine months of 2020, mainly due to the planned lower gold production together with higher realized input costs in the first nine months of 2021 (resulting from higher period stripping activities, higher fuel and processing costs and higher import duties). Total AISC (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) for the first nine months of 2021 were <span class=""xn-money"">$900</span> per ounce sold (first nine months of 2020 - <span class=""xn-money"">$740</span> per ounce sold) and consolidated AISC from the Company's three operating mines were <span class=""xn-money"">$887</span> per ounce sold (first nine months of 2020 - <span class=""xn-money"">$726</span> per ounce sold), both approximately in-line with budget.  For full-year 2021, based on strong production performance in the first nine months of 2021, the Company has increased its total gold production guidance to between 1,015,000 - 1,055,000 ounces (including 50,000 – 60,000 attributable ounces projected from Calibre) (original guidance was between 970,000 and 1,030,000 ounces). For full-year 2021, the Company's total consolidated cash operating costs are expected to be within the Company's guidance range of between <span class=""xn-money"">$500</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$540</span> per ounce and total consolidated AISC are expected to be at the upper-end of the Company's guidance range of between <span class=""xn-money"">$870</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$910</span> per ounce. The Company is still forecasting to meet its total consolidated cost per ounce guidance ranges even in the current inflationary cost environment, reflecting how well the Company's operating mines and their management teams have performed and continue to perform in 2021. <b>Third Quarter and First Nine Months of 2021 Financial Results </b> For the third quarter of 2021, consolidated gold revenue was <span class=""xn-money"">$511 million</span> on sales of 286,650 ounces at an average realized gold price of <span class=""xn-money"">$1,782</span> per ounce, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$487 million</span> on sales of 253,200 ounces at an average realized gold price of <span class=""xn-money"">$1,924</span> per ounce in the third quarter of 2020. The increase in gold revenue of 5% (<span class=""xn-money"">$24 million</span>) was 13% attributable to the increase in gold ounces sold (mainly due to the higher gold production and timing of gold shipments), partially offset by an 8% impact from the decrease in the average realized gold price.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cash flow provided by operating activities was <span class=""xn-money"">$320 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021 compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$300 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020. The increase over the third quarter of 2020 was mainly due to higher inflows of value added tax receivables in the third quarter of 2021. Operating cashflows in the third quarter of 2021 benefitted from higher than budgeted gold production and sales volumes as well as from the timing of refunds for certain value added tax receivables and other working capital items. Based on current assumptions, including an average gold price of <span class=""xn-money"">$1,800</span> per ounce for the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company is now forecasting to generate cashflows from operating activities of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$650 million</span> (original guidance was <span class=""xn-money"">$630 million</span>) for the full-year 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Net income for the third quarter of 2021 was <span class=""xn-money"">$135 million</span> compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$277 million</span> for the third quarter of 2020. Net income attributable to the shareholders of the Company was <span class=""xn-money"">$123 million</span> (<span class=""xn-money"">$0.12</span> per share) compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$263 million</span> (<span class=""xn-money"">$0.25</span> per share) for the third quarter of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, the Company identified a higher sustained long-term gold price as an indicator of impairment reversal for the Masbate Mine resulting in a net impairment reversal of <span class=""xn-money"">$122 million</span> (pre-tax <span class=""xn-money"">$174 million</span> impairment reversal less <span class=""xn-money"">$52 million</span> deferred tax expense). Adjusted net income attributable to the shareholders of the Company <i>(see ""Non-IFRS Measures"")</i> was <span class=""xn-money"">$123 million</span> (<span class=""xn-money"">$0.12</span> per share) for the third quarter of 2021 compared to adjusted net income of <span class=""xn-money"">$161 million</span> (<span class=""xn-money"">$0.15</span> per share) for the third quarter of 2020.  For the first nine months of 2021, consolidated gold revenue was <span class=""xn-money"">$1.2 billion</span> on sales of 689,051 ounces at an average realized gold price of <span class=""xn-money"">$1,794</span> per ounce compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$1.3 billion</span> on sales of 749,800 ounces at an average realized gold price of <span class=""xn-money"">$1,746</span> per ounce in the first nine months of 2020. The decrease in gold revenue of 6% (<span class=""xn-money"">$73 million</span>) was mainly attributable to the decrease in gold ounces sold (mainly due to the lower gold production and timing of gold shipments).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cash flow provided by operating activities was <span class=""xn-money"">$458 million</span> in the first nine months of 2021 compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$754 million</span> in the first nine months of 2020. The decrease was mainly due to lower revenues of <span class=""xn-money"">$73 million</span>, higher production costs of <span class=""xn-money"">$81 million</span> and higher working capital outflows in the first nine months of 2021, most significantly for value-added taxes and current income and other taxes payables. Current income tax payments in the first nine months of 2021 included approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$140 million</span> related to 2020 outstanding tax liability obligations (comprised mainly of Fekola outstanding 2020 tax liabilities of <span class=""xn-money"">$75 million</span> and Fekola 2020 priority dividend obligations of <span class=""xn-money"">$46 million</span>). Based on current assumptions, including an average gold price of <span class=""xn-money"">$1,800</span> per ounce for 2021, the Company is forecasting to make total cash income tax payments in 2021 of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$380 million</span>, including the <span class=""xn-money"">$140 million</span> related to 2020 outstanding tax liability obligations discussed above.  For the first nine months of 2021, net income was <span class=""xn-money"">$308 million</span> compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$498 million</span> for the first nine months of 2020. Net income attributable to the shareholders of the Company was <span class=""xn-money"">$283 million</span> (<span class=""xn-money"">$0.27</span> per share) compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$460 million</span> (<span class=""xn-money"">$0.44</span> per share) for the first nine months of 2020. Adjusted net income attributable to the shareholders of the Company was <span class=""xn-money"">$272 million</span> (<span class=""xn-money"">$0.26</span> per share) for the first nine months of 2021 compared to adjusted net income of <span class=""xn-money"">$368 million</span> (<span class=""xn-money"">$0.35</span> per share) for the first nine months of 2020.  <b>Liquidity and Capital Resources</b> B2Gold continues to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity. At <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of <span class=""xn-money"">$547 million</span> (<span class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2020</span> - <span class=""xn-money"">$480 million</span>) and working capital of <span class=""xn-money"">$683 million</span> (<span class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2020</span> - <span class=""xn-money"">$465 million</span>). In addition, the Company's <span class=""xn-money"">$600 million</span> Revolving Credit Facility remains fully undrawn and available.  Due to the Company's strong net positive cash position, strong operating results and the current higher gold price environment, B2Gold's quarterly dividend rate is expected to be maintained at <span class=""xn-money"">$0.04</span> per common share (or an annualized rate of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.16</span> per common share), one of the highest dividend yields in the gold sector.  Based on current assumptions, including an average gold price of <span class=""xn-money"">$1,800</span> per ounce for the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company is now forecasting to generate cashflows from operating activities of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$650 million</span> (original guidance was <span class=""xn-money"">$630 million</span>) for the full-year 2021.&nbsp; <b>Operations<br class=""dnr""></b> Mine-by-mine gold production in the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 (including the Company's estimated 33% share of Calibre's production) was as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;  <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Mine</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Q3 2021 <br class=""dnr""></b></span><span class=""prnews_span""><b>Gold Production <br class=""dnr""></b></span><span class=""prnews_span""><b>(ounces) </b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>First Nine Months <br class=""dnr""></b></span><span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021 <br class=""dnr""></b></span><span class=""prnews_span""><b>Gold Production<br class=""dnr""></b></span><span class=""prnews_span""><b>(ounces) </b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Revised <br class=""dnr""></b></span><span class=""prnews_span""><b>Full-Year <br class=""dnr""></b></span><span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021 Guidance <br class=""dnr""></b></span><span class=""prnews_span""><b>Gold Production <br class=""dnr"">(ounces)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Original&nbsp;<br class=""dnr""></b></span><span class=""prnews_span""><b>Full-Year&nbsp;<br class=""dnr""></b></span><span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021 Guidance <br class=""dnr""></b></span><span class=""prnews_span""><b>Gold Production <br class=""dnr"">(ounces)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Fekola</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">165,557</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">404,256</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">560,000 - 570,000</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">530,000 - 560,000</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Masbate</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">61,207</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">175,598</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">215,000 - 225,000</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">200,000 - 210,000</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Otjikoto</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">68,959</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">118,892</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">190,000 - 200,000</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">190,000 - 200,000</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b><i>B2Gold <br class=""dnr"">Consolidated <sup>(1)</sup></i></b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>295,723</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>698,746</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>965,000 - 995,000</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>920,000 - 970,000</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b><i>Equity interest <br class=""dnr"">in Calibre <sup>(2)</sup></i></b>&nbsp;</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>14,538</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>43,771</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>50,000 - 60,000</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>50,000 - 60,000</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Total </b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>310,261</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>742,517</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>1,015,000 - <br class=""dnr"">1,055,000</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>970,000 - <br class=""dnr"">1,030,000</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>(1)</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>""B2Gold Consolidated"" - gold production is presented on a 100% basis, as B2Gold fully consolidates the results of its Fekola, Masbate and Otjikoto mines in its consolidated financial statements (even though it does not own 100% of these operations).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>(2)</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>""Equity interest in Calibre"" - represents the Company's approximate 33% indirect share of the operations of Calibre's El Limon and La Libertad mines.

The increase was due to higher mill throughput, partially offset by lower processed grade, as Fekola's low-grade stockpiles were used to supplement the additional unbudgeted mill feed required as a result of the higher than budgeted processed tonnes. As planned, with the completion of the waste stripping campaign relating to the development of Phases 5 and 6 of the Fekola Pit in the first half of 2021, Fekola's gold production increased significantly by 46% (51,946 ounces) over the second quarter of 2021, as mining reached the higher-grade zones in Phase 5 of the Fekola Pit in the third quarter of 2021. In <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2021</span>, the Fekola Mine produced its 2 millionth ounce of gold, 4 years from the commencement of production.  For the third quarter of 2021, mill feed grade was 2.30 grams per tonne (""g/t"") compared to budget of 2.71 g/t and 3.22 g/t in the third quarter of 2020; mill throughput was 2.36 million tonnes compared to budget of 1.91 million tonnes and 1.56 million tonnes in the third quarter of 2020; and gold recovery averaged 94.8% compared to budget of 94.0% and 94.6% in the third quarter of 2020. Fekola's processing facilities continued to outperform in the third quarter of 2021 (following the successful completion of the Fekola mill expansion in <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2020</span>) with record quarterly throughput of 2.36 million tonnes, 24% above budget and 51% higher than the third quarter of 2020. The higher than budgeted mill throughput was due to favourable ore fragmentation and hardness, as well as optimization of the grinding circuit. Based on the positive results noted to date through to the third quarter of 2021, Fekola's annualized throughput rate is now expected to average 8.3 million tonnes per annum (""Mtpa"") for 2021 and average approximately 9.0 Mtpa (over the long-term), based on an ore blend including fresh rock and weathered material (saprolite).  After review of an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment by the Malian authorities, the existing Medinandi (Fekola) permit has been updated to include the Cardinal zone, located within 500 metres of the current Fekola resource pit (the initial Inferred Mineral Resource estimate for Cardinal is 640,000 ounces of gold in 13.0 million tonnes of ore at 1.54 g/t gold). Exploration drilling at Cardinal is ongoing and recent drill results have returned good gold grades over significant widths below the current resource which remains open at depth and along strike. Initial mining operations at Cardinal have commenced and will continue to ramp up. To <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, 95,489 tonnes at an average grade of 1.45 g/t have been mined at Cardinal. The Company is in the process of updating the Fekola Mine Plan to include production from Cardinal which has the potential to add an average of approximately 60,000 ounces per year over the next 6 to 8 years (based on Cardinal's inferred resource only) to Fekola's annual gold production. Grade control drilling at Cardinal is ongoing to upgrade a portion of the Mineral Resource estimate to the Indicated category for 2022 production budget purposes.  For the third quarter of 2021, Fekola's cash operating costs were <span class=""xn-money"">$363</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$424</span> per ounce sold) (Q3 2020 - <span class=""xn-money"">$333</span> per ounce produced), approximately in-line with budget, as higher than budgeted gold production largely offset the impact of higher than budgeted fuel and processing costs, less capitalized waste stripping than budgeted and higher than budgeted site general and camp costs related to COVID-19 mitigation measures. Fekola's AISC for the third quarter of 2021 were <span class=""xn-money"">$716</span> per ounce sold (Q3 2020 - <span class=""xn-money"">$584</span> per ounce sold), approximately in-line with budget, as higher than budgeted gold ounces sold together with higher than budgeted realized gains on fuel derivatives and lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures (mainly due to lower than budgeted pre-stripping costs) were largely offset by higher than budgeted operating costs discussed above. The lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures were primarily the result of timing of expenditures and are expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first nine months of 2021, the Fekola Mine produced 404,256 ounces of gold, above budget by 6% (21,256 ounces) for the reasons outlined above. As expected, compared to the first nine months of 2020, gold production was lower by 13% (59,714 ounces) as a result of the higher planned waste stripping and lower mined ore grades in the first half of 2021, as Phases 5 and 6 of the Fekola Pit were developed.&nbsp;  For the first nine months of 2021, Fekola's cash operating costs were <span class=""xn-money"">$478</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$494</span> per gold ounce sold), approximately in-line with budget. As expected, Fekola's cash operating were higher than <span class=""xn-money"">$294</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$299</span> per ounce sold) in the first nine months of 2020, mainly due to the planned lower production together with higher fuel and processing costs. Fekola's AISC for the first nine months of 2021 were <span class=""xn-money"">$772</span> per ounce sold (first nine months of 2020 - <span class=""xn-money"">$556</span> per ounce sold), approximately in-line with budget.&nbsp;&nbsp; Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2021 totaled <span class=""xn-money"">$28 million</span>, primarily consisting of <span class=""xn-money"">$15 million</span> for pre-stripping, <span class=""xn-money"">$5 million</span> for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds, <span class=""xn-money"">$3 million</span> for tailings storage facility expansion and equipment, <span class=""xn-money"">$2 million</span> for the development of Cardinal and <span class=""xn-money"">$1 million</span> for the solar plant. Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2021 totaled <span class=""xn-money"">$54 million</span>, primarily consisting of <span class=""xn-money"">$22 million</span> for pre-stripping, <span class=""xn-money"">$9 million</span> for the solar plant, <span class=""xn-money"">$7 million</span> for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds, <span class=""xn-money"">$4 million</span> for the development of Cardinal and <span class=""xn-money"">$3 million</span> for tailings storage facility expansion and equipment. Due to the high processing throughput rates achieved with a blend of fresh rock and saprolite ore, expansion of Fekola's existing tailings storage facility is required one year ahead of schedule and commenced in the third quarter of 2021. Design and planning for a new tailings storage facility is also underway, with construction commencing as early as in the fourth quarter of 2022. Based on Fekola's strong year-to-date performance, the Company has increased Fekola's annual production guidance range to between 560,000 to 570,000 ounces of gold (original guidance range was between 530,000 to 560,000 ounces). Cash operating costs for the year are expected to be at the upper end of Fekola's guidance range of between <span class=""xn-money"">$405</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$445</span> per ounce and AISC are also expected to be at the upper end of Fekola's guidance range of between <span class=""xn-money"">$745</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$785</span> per ounce.  <i>Menankoto Permit&nbsp; </i> As previously disclosed, the Company has formally commenced arbitration proceedings against the Republic of <span class=""xn-location"">Mali</span> with respect to the renewal of the Menankoto exploration permit (the ""Menankoto Permit"") which forms part of the <span class=""xn-location"">Anaconda Area</span> and is located 20 kilometers north of the Fekola Mine licence area. Notwithstanding the commencement of arbitration proceedings, the Company is committed to continuing its ongoing discussions with the Malian Government to resolve the issue and remains optimistic that the renewal dispute can be resolved over the course of the next few months. Since the Company commenced its investment in <span class=""xn-location"">Mali</span>, B2Gold has always enjoyed a positive and mutually beneficial relationship with the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mali</span>. Most recently, B2Gold partnered with the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mali</span> to assist the people of <span class=""xn-location"">Mali</span> facing challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its impact on the mining sector. B2Gold continues to explore additional ways in which it might help the Government and local communities to deal with the impact of the pandemic. We believe that continued exploration success in <span class=""xn-location"">Mali</span> has the potential to deliver significant production upside in both the near term and over the longer term. The operations at the Fekola Mine, which is situated on a separate mining licence 20 kilometres from the Menankoto Permit and is now projected to produce 560,000 to 570,000 ounces of gold in 2021, continue normally and have not been impacted by the dispute relating to the Menankoto Permit. In addition, the Fekola Mine has not included the Mineral Resources from the <span class=""xn-location"">Anaconda</span> area (comprised of the Menankoto Permit and the Bantako North permit) in the current Fekola life of mine plan. The Bantako North permit area (wholly owned and which permit was recently renewed for an additional 3-year term) contains a significant portion of the Mamba deposit saprolite material and remains open. Preliminary planning by the Company has demonstrated that a pit situated on the Bantako North permit area could provide saprolite material for at least 1.5 to 2 years to feed the Fekola mill commencing in 2022 subject to obtaining all necessary permits and completion of a final mine plan. This additional feed to the Fekola mill would benefit all stakeholders, including the <span class=""xn-location"">State of Mali</span>, B2Gold's 20% partner at the Fekola Mine.  <u>Masbate Gold Mine – <span class=""xn-location"">the Philippines</span></u> The Masbate Mine in <span class=""xn-location"">the Philippines</span> also continued its strong operational performance with third quarter of 2021 gold production of 61,207 ounces, well above budget by 16% (8,236 ounces), as grade and recovery both exceeded budget, and 14% (7,600 ounces) higher compared to the third quarter of 2020, due to higher grade.  For the third quarter of 2021, mill feed grade was 1.24 g/t compared to budget of 1.12 g/t and 1.05 g/t in the third quarter of 2020; mill throughput was 1.84 million tonnes compared to budget of 2.05 million tonnes and 1.97 million tonnes in the third quarter of 2020; and gold recovery averaged 81.6% compared to budget of 71.9% and 81.1% in the third quarter of 2020. In the third quarter of 2021, Masbate's mill recoveries continued to outperform the recovery model and high-grade ore mined from both the Main Vein and <span class=""xn-location"">Montana</span> pits produced higher tonnage compared to the reserve model. In addition, high grade zones of the Main Vein Pit, originally scheduled to be mined in the fourth quarter of 2021, were mined and processed in the third quarter of 2021, bringing gold production forward from the fourth quarter of 2021.&nbsp;Masbate's mill throughput was below budget in the third quarter of 2021 as the Company took the opportunity to accelerate mill maintenance activities due to the positive variances on mill feed grade and recoveries which benefited Masbate's gold production in the third quarter.  For the third quarter of 2021, Masbate's cash operating costs were <span class=""xn-money"">$609</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$546</span> per ounce sold), below budget by <span class=""xn-money"">$35</span> per ounce produced (5%), mainly due to higher than budgeted production, partially offset by higher than budgeted fuel prices, and comparable with the third quarter of 2020. Masbate's AISC for the third quarter of 2021 were <span class=""xn-money"">$751</span> per ounce sold, significantly below budget by <span class=""xn-money"">$198</span> per ounce sold (21%), mainly due to higher than budgeted gold ounces sold, higher than budgeted realized gains on fuel derivatives and lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures. The lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures were primarily the result of timing of expenditures and are expected to be incurred either in the fourth quarter of 2021 or in 2022. Compared to the third quarter of 2020, Masbate's AISC were also significantly lower by <span class=""xn-money"">$321</span> per ounce sold (30%), mainly due to an increase (of 41%) in gold ounces sold in the third quarter of 2021 (attributable to both higher production and timing of gold sales). For the first nine months of 2021, the Masbate Mine produced 175,598 ounces of gold, well above budget by 12% (19,478 ounces) for the reasons outlined above, and 19% (28,465 ounces) higher than the first nine months of 2020, mainly due to higher mined ore grades as a result of mining through higher-grade zones of the Main Vein and <span class=""xn-location"">Montana</span> pits in the first nine months of 2021. For the first nine months of 2021, Masbate's cash operating costs were <span class=""xn-money"">$611</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$597</span> per ounce sold), below both budget by <span class=""xn-money"">$66</span> per ounce produced (10%) and the first nine months of 2020 by <span class=""xn-money"">$35</span> per ounce produced (5%), mainly due to higher production, partially offset by higher fuel prices. Masbate's AISC for the first nine months of 2021 were <span class=""xn-money"">$820</span> per ounce sold, significantly below both budget by <span class=""xn-money"">$162</span> per ounce sold (16%) and the first nine months of 2020 by <span class=""xn-money"">$192</span> per ounce sold (19%) for the reasons outlined above.  Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2021 totaled <span class=""xn-money"">$7 million</span>, primarily consisting of <span class=""xn-money"">$2 million</span> for tailings storage facility projects, <span class=""xn-money"">$1 million</span> for power plant maintenance, <span class=""xn-money"">$1 million</span> for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds, and <span class=""xn-money"">$1 million</span> for process plant equipment. Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2021 totaled <span class=""xn-money"">$20 million</span>, primarily consisting of <span class=""xn-money"">$6 million</span> for tailings storage facility projects, <span class=""xn-money"">$5 million</span> for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds, <span class=""xn-money"">$3 million</span> for pre-stripping costs and <span class=""xn-money"">$3 million</span> for process plant equipment. Based on Masbate's strong year-to-date performance, the Company has increased Masbate's production guidance range to between 215,000 to 225,000 ounces of gold (original guidance range was between 200,000 to 210,000 ounces). In the fourth quarter of 2021, Masbate's gold production is expected to be approximately 45,000 ounces, reflecting the fact that a portion of its budgeted fourth quarter production was rescheduled and mined in the third quarter of 2021. Masbate's cash operating costs for the year are expected to be within the guidance range of between <span class=""xn-money"">$650</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$690</span> per ounce and AISC are expected to be at or below the low end of Masbate's guidance range of between <span class=""xn-money"">$955</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$995</span> per ounce.  <u>Otjikoto Gold Mine – <span class=""xn-location"">Namibia</span></u> The Otjikoto Mine in <span class=""xn-location"">Namibia</span> also had a strong third quarter with record quarterly gold production of 68,959 ounces of gold, above budget by 3% (2,290 ounces), mainly due to higher than budgeted throughput. As planned, with the completion of the waste stripping campaigns at the Wolfshag and Otjikoto pits in the first half of 2021, Otjikoto's gold production increased significantly by 62% (26,368 ounces) compared to the third quarter of 2020, as mining reached the higher-grade zone at the base of the Wolfshag Pit in the third quarter of 2021. Otjikoto's gold production also increased significantly by 156% (42,068 ounces) over the second quarter of 2021.  For the third quarter of 2021, mill feed grade was 2.41 g/t compared to budget of 2.46 g/t and 1.53 g/t in the third quarter of 2020; mill throughput was 0.90 million tonnes compared to budget of 0.86 million tonnes and 0.88 million tonnes in the third quarter of 2020; and gold recovery averaged 98.7% compared to budget of 98.3% and 98.2% in the third quarter of 2020.  For the third quarter of 2021, Otjikoto's cash operating costs were <span class=""xn-money"">$382</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$443</span> per ounce sold) (Q3 2020 - <span class=""xn-money"">$435</span> per ounce produced), approximately in-line with budget. Otjikoto's cash operating costs per ounce were on budget in the third quarter of 2021 as the impact of higher than budgeted fuel prices and a stronger Namibian dollar were offset by higher than budgeted capitalized pre-stripping costs. Otjikoto's AISC for the third quarter of 2021 were <span class=""xn-money"">$781</span> per ounce sold (Q3 2020 - <span class=""xn-money"">$917</span> per ounce sold), above budget by <span class=""xn-money"">$129</span> per ounce sold (20%), mainly due to higher than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures (due to higher than budgeted costs for pre-stripping and the timing of equipment rebuilds) and lower than budgeted gold ounces sold (12%) as a result of timing of gold sales.  For the first nine months of 2021, the Otjikoto Mine produced 118,892 ounces of gold, above budget by 6% (6,427 ounces), mainly due to higher than budgeted throughput, and 7% (8,944 ounces) lower than the first nine months of 2020 due to the focus on waste stripping in the first half of 2021.  For the first nine months of 2021, Otjikoto's cash operating costs were <span class=""xn-money"">$597</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$635</span> per gold ounce sold), approximately in-line with budget and, as expected, higher than the first nine months of 2020 of <span class=""xn-money"">$432</span> per ounce produced (<span class=""xn-money"">$419</span> per ounce sold), mainly due to the lower planned production together with higher fuel prices and a stronger Namibian dollar. Otjikoto's AISC for the first nine months of 2021 were <span class=""xn-money"">$1,137</span> per ounce sold (first nine months of 2020 - <span class=""xn-money"">$841</span> per ounce sold), above budget by <span class=""xn-money"">$89</span> per ounce sold (8%), as a result of higher than budgeted sustaining capital costs (due to higher than budgeted costs for pre-stripping and the timing of equipment rebuilds). The higher than budgeted pre-stripping costs of <span class=""xn-money"">$6 million</span> for the first nine months of 2021 are expected to be a permanent variance.  Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2021 totaled <span class=""xn-money"">$19 million</span>, primarily consisting of <span class=""xn-money"">$10 million</span> for pre-stripping in the Otjikoto Pit, <span class=""xn-money"">$5 million</span> for Wolfshag underground project development, <span class=""xn-money"">$3 million</span> for mobile equipment rebuilds and replacements, and <span class=""xn-money"">$1 million</span> for the national power grid connection line. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2021 totaled <span class=""xn-money"">$59 million</span>, primarily consisting of <span class=""xn-money"">$33 million</span> for pre-stripping in the Otjikoto and Wolfshag pits, <span class=""xn-money"">$14 million</span> for Wolfshag underground project development, <span class=""xn-money"">$7 million</span> for mobile equipment rebuilds and replacements and <span class=""xn-money"">$3 million</span> for the national power grid connection line. Development of the Wolfshag underground mine continues to progress with stope ore production expected to commence in early 2022. The initial underground Mineral Reserve estimate for the down-plunge extension of the Wolfshag deposit included 210,000 ounces of gold in 1.2 million tonnes of ore at 5.57 g/t gold. For full-year 2021, the Otjikoto Mine remains on track to produce between 190,000 - 200,000 ounces of gold. Otjikoto's cash operating costs are expected to be within the guidance range of between <span class=""xn-money"">$480</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$520</span> per ounce and AISC are expected to be at or above the upper end of Otjikoto's guidance range of <span class=""xn-money"">$830</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$870</span> per ounce. <b>2021 Development </b> <u>Gramalote Project (B2Gold – 50%/AngloGold Ashanti Limited – 50%) - <span class=""xn-location"">Colombia</span></u> The Gramalote Project, owned 50% B2Gold/50% AngloGold Ashanti Limited (""AngloGold"") is located in central <span class=""xn-location"">Colombia</span>, northeast of <span class=""xn-location"">Medellin</span>, in the Province of Antioquia.  Following a review of Gramalote's feasibility study work to date, B2Gold believes that there is strong potential to improve the economics of the project (economic highlights were previously released on <span class=""xn-chron"">May 4, 2021</span> based on the feasibility study work to date), which could be developed by revisiting the original Gramalote Project design parameters included in the existing mining permit (as applied in the Gramalote Preliminary Economic Assessment in <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2020</span> and historical AngloGold studies) and further optimizing project design. Review of the updated Gramalote Ridge Mineral Resource also shows that further value can be created through additional drilling of the Inferred portions of the Mineral Resource area, both within and adjacent to the designed pit, with at least 25,000 metres of drilling planned and progressing in 2021 and a mineral resource update expected in early 2022. In addition, drilling is being carried out at the <span class=""xn-location"">Trinidad</span> deposit during the remainder of 2021.  The Gramalote Project team is advancing work on different project optimization opportunities to potentially reduce capital and operating costs, as well as improve operability and sustainability of the Gramalote Project. Those activities include road optimization and layout, pit design and phasing, blast design optimization, river deviation changes, improved infrastructure layout, and further optimization of plant design. As noted, optimization efforts also include continuing exploration drilling at the Gramalote deposit with additional drilling at the <span class=""xn-location"">Trinidad</span> deposit, continuing to implement the Resettlement Action Plan, advancing the purchase of key properties required for project development, entering into a development agreement with a power company to commence studies to bring power to the Gramalote mill site, continuing the process of formalization and removal of artisanal miners to outside of the industrial area, and completing environmental and social studies necessary to support the permit modifications that are identified as part of the optimization process.  As the evaluation of the different optimization opportunities advances, B2Gold is reviewing what changes in the design could require minor and major permit amendments of the approved Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). The supporting environmental and social studies continue to move forward as planned. B2Gold expects that any minor or major permit amendments required could potentially impact the development timeline and delivery of the final feasibility study for the Gramalote Project which is now expected in the second quarter of 2022. Completion of the feasibility study is now scheduled for the second quarter of 2022 as a result of an increase in planned drilling and the impact of ongoing COVID-19 restrictions. The revised 2021 budget of <span class=""xn-money"">$69 million</span> represents an increase of <span class=""xn-money"">$17 million</span> (Company's share <span class=""xn-money"">$8.5 million</span>) over the initial announced 2021 Gramalote Project budget of <span class=""xn-money"">$52 million</span>. If the final economics of the feasibility study are positive and B2Gold and AngloGold make the decision to develop Gramalote as an open-pit gold mine (decision date expected mid-2022), B2Gold would utilize its proven internal mine construction team to build the mine and mill facilities and operate the mine on behalf of the Gramalote Project. The Gramalote Project continues to benefit from strong federal and local government support as well as continuing support from local communities.  <b>Summary and Outlook</b> The Company is pleased with its third quarter and first nine months of 2021 gold production results. Based on a strong first nine months of 2021, the Company has increased its total gold production guidance to between 1,015,000 and 1,055,000 ounces (including 50,000 to 60,000 attributable ounces projected from Calibre) (original guidance was between 970,000 and 1,030,000 ounces). For full-year 2021, the Company's total consolidated cash operating costs are expected to be within the guidance range of between <span class=""xn-money"">$500</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$540</span> per ounce and total consolidated AISC are expected to be at the upper-end of the Company's guidance range of between <span class=""xn-money"">$870</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$910</span> per ounce. The Company is still forecasting to meet its total consolidated cost per ounce guidance ranges even in the current inflationary cost environment, reflecting how well the Company's operating mines and their management teams have performed and continue to perform in 2021. Due to the Company's strong net positive cash position, strong operating results and the current higher gold price environment, B2Gold's quarterly dividend rate is expected to be maintained at <span class=""xn-money"">$0.04</span> per common share (or an annualized rate of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.16</span> per common share), one of the highest dividend yields in the gold sector.  The Company also continues to advance its development projects while at the same time reviewing its portfolio and divesting non-core assets which it determines do not meet the Company's investment criteria. Work continues on the Gramalote Project and based on a review of the feasibility study work to date, B2Gold believes that there is strong potential for a more robust project and has recently agreed a revised 2021 budget with its 50% joint venture partner, AngloGold, to advance the scope of planned feasibility study work and for additional infill drilling of the inferred portion of the Gramalote Mineral Resource and further drilling of the <span class=""xn-location"">Trinidad</span> deposit. Completion of the Gramalote feasibility study is now scheduled for the second quarter of 2022 as a result of an increase in planned drilling and the impact of ongoing COVID-19 restrictions. On <span class=""xn-chron"">October 25, 2021</span>, the Company entered into an agreement with WAF to sell the Company's 81% interest in the Kiaka Project in <span class=""xn-location"">Burkina Faso</span> for a combination of cash, WAF shares and production royalties. This allows the Company to both monetize its investment in Kiaka to-date while at the same time benefit from the future development of the project. Following a very successful year for exploration in 2020, B2Gold is conducting an aggressive exploration campaign in 2021 with a budget of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$66 million</span> (excluding the Gramalote Project). Exploration is focused predominantly in <span class=""xn-location"">Mali</span>, other operating mine sites in <span class=""xn-location"">Namibia</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">the Philippines</span> and grassroots exploration programs around the world. Many years of target generation and pursuing opportunities in prospective gold regions have culminated in the Company allocating a record <span class=""xn-money"">$25 million</span> in 2021 to high quality targets for its grassroots exploration programs, including several new regions. This is evidenced by the recent positive exploration drill results at the Company's joint venture in <span class=""xn-location"">Finland</span>. In <span class=""xn-location"">Mali</span>, and notwithstanding the commencement of arbitration proceedings related to the renewal of the Menankoto Permit, the Company is committed to continuing its ongoing discussions with the Malian Government to resolve the issue and remains optimistic that the renewal dispute can be resolved over the course of the next few months. Since the Company commenced its investment in <span class=""xn-location"">Mali</span>, B2Gold has always enjoyed a positive and mutually beneficial relationship with the Government of <span class=""xn-location"">Mali</span>.  The Company's ongoing strategy is to continue to maximize profitable production from its mines, further advance its pipeline of development and exploration projects, evaluate new exploration, development and production opportunities and continue to pay an industry leading dividend yield. <b>Third Quarter 2021 Financial Results – Conference Call/Webcast Details</b> B2Gold executives will host a conference call to discuss the results on <span class=""xn-chron"">Wednesday, November 3, 2021</span>, at <span class=""xn-chron"">10:00am PDT</span>/<span class=""xn-chron"">1:00pm EDT</span>.

 Final CMS rule will harm patient access to care, which has already been significantly impacted by the pandemic News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 18:59 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">WASHINGTON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) final rule released today by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), scheduled to take effect in less than two months, will limit patient access to care at a time when the health care system is already destabilized due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final rule includes a harmful 3.75 percent cut to surgeons and surgical practices. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) calls on Congress to reverse these significant cuts that will hurt patients and their providers.  ""Surgeons and their patients have already been significantly impacted by the pandemic,"" said ACS Executive Director <span class=""xn-person"">David B. Hoyt</span>, MD, FACS. ""These Medicare cuts will further exacerbate our pandemic-strained health care system and cause further delay in care to the patients who need it most."" This cut means that on <span class=""xn-chron"">January 1, 2022</span>, a 3.75 percent cut, combined with automatic Medicare cuts, will slash Medicare payments to surgeons by nearly 9 percent. A recent survey of ACS members shows a majority of surgeons believe these cuts will result in longer wait times for patients and delays to care. As COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have already caused Americans to delay needed care, these cuts will only further strain health care systems nationwide.&nbsp;  A bipartisan majority of the U.S. House of Representatives supports stopping the cuts. Representatives <span class=""xn-person"">Ami Bera</span>, MD (D-Calif.) and <span class=""xn-person"">Larry Bucshon</span>, MD (R-Ind.) recently led a <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3345214-1&amp;h=2744526042&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fbera.house.gov%2Fsites%2Fbera.house.gov%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments%2FPhysician%2520Pay%25202021.10.14%2520final.pdf&amp;a=bipartisan+letter"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bipartisan letter</a> to Speaker of the House of Representatives <span class=""xn-person"">Nancy Pelosi</span> (D-Calif.) and House Minority Leader <span class=""xn-person"">Kevin McCarthy</span> (R-Calif.), signed by 247 U.S. Representatives and supported by 135 national medical groups, urging them to stop these harmful cuts. In the coming weeks, the ACS, alongside the Surgical Care Coalition, will continue to advocate for Congress to protect patients and the care they need. The ACS is a founding member of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3345214-1&amp;h=2760913694&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.surgicalcare.org%2F&amp;a=Surgical+Care+Coalition"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Surgical Care Coalition</a>, which advocates for access to quality surgical care for all Americans. The Surgical Care Coalition is comprised of 13 surgical professional associations that proudly represent the more than 150,000 surgeons working across the country with a common goal of improving the quality of care, and quality of life, for all patients. <b>About the American College of Surgeons<br class=""dnr""></b>The American College of Surgeons is a scientific and educational organization of surgeons that was founded in 1913 to raise the standards of surgical practice and improve the quality of care for all surgical patients.

(TSX: WEF) (""Western"" or the ""Company"") today provides an initial response to the <span class=""xn-location"">British Columbia</span> provincial government's (the ""Province"") update on its review of old growth forest management.  The Province has announced its intention to work in partnership with First Nations on the proposed deferral of harvesting in 2.6 million hectares of BC forests. The proposed deferrals, if implemented, have been identified as temporary, and are subject to First Nations engagement. The Province continues to state that final decisions on deferral areas will be based on discussions between the Province and First Nations governments.  Western requires more specific information on the Province's proposed measures to meaningfully assess any potential impacts on the Company's business. Determination of potential impacts will be subject to further dialogue with the First Nations on whose territories the Company operates and their government-to-government discussions. Should the proposed measures impact Western's business, the Company will seek support from the Province for its workers and full compensation for investments.

Western respects government-to-government engagement and the critical role First Nations have in decisions that may affect them.  Western has been working with First Nations for many years to foster positive working relationships built on respect for Aboriginal rights and title, including the right of First Nations to economically benefit from the lands within their territories. Western appreciates and welcomes the opportunity we have been given by many of our Indigenous partners to support and participate in these important processes.  Western has achieved a series of milestone agreements with Indigenous partners in 2021 that advance our mutually beneficial relationships and exemplify the Company's ongoing actions to support reconciliation. These actions include the collaboration on and co-development of: We appreciate the opportunity to work together with these and other First Nations in advancing sustainable forest management. <b>About Western Forest Products Inc. </b> Western is an integrated forest products company building a margin-focused log and lumber business to compete successfully in global softwood markets.

Most of these Veterans have sustained life-altering injuries including multiple limb amputations, partial or full paralysis, and/or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).&nbsp;These homes restore some of the freedom and independence our Veterans sacrificed while defending our country, and enable them to focus on their family, recovery, and rebuilding their lives. HFOT builds these homes where the Veteran chooses to live, and continues its relationship with the Veterans after home delivery to assist them with rebuilding their lives. Since its inception in 2004, nearly 90 cents of every dollar spent has gone directly to our program services supporting Veterans.

(2) Defendants knew, recklessly disregarded, or should have known that they owed a fiduciary duty, or obligation arising from a similar relationship of trust and confidence, to Archegos to keep the information confidential. (3) Nevertheless, while in possession of material, non-public adverse information, Defendants collectively sold billions of dollars' worth of Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS) shares. During one week in late <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2021</span>, investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley traded on inside information by selling large amounts of VIPS stock based on then publicly undisclosed information obtained through their relationship with troubled multi-billion dollar family office Archegos Capital Management.

(provisional liquidators appointed) (""SeaMex""), including the shares in its subsidiaries (the ""SeaMex Subsidiaries"") by the joint provisional liquidators of SeaMex to a newly incorporated wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer.  Consideration for the sale of assets contemplated by the SPA included the release of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$300 million</span> of intercompany debt owing to one of the Issuer's indirect subsidiaries, resulting in a significantly deleveraged capital structure for the SeaMex Subsidiaries.&nbsp; Furthermore, as outlined in the Previous Announcements, the SeaMex Subsidiaries will have access to additional liquidity following a refinancing transaction that completed on <span class=""xn-chron"">August 31, 2021</span>, and receipt of recent payments from their key customer, Pemex Exploración y Producción.&nbsp; Consideration for the sale also included the release of the guarantee provided by SeaMex in respect of the SeaMex Subsidiaries' new secured notes, with a subsidiary of the Issuer acceding as guarantor in respect of the notes.&nbsp; The completion of the SPA was subject to certain customary conditions, including certain antitrust approvals.&nbsp;  As outlined in the Previous Announcements, completion of the SPA is a key step in the overall restructuring of SeaMex, which has the support of approximately 81% of the Issuer's secured creditors, and 100% of the SeaMex Subsidiaries' secured creditors.&nbsp; The sale is at the holding company level only and will not impact the operational activities of the business.&nbsp;&nbsp; There will similarly be no impact to employees, customers or suppliers. The Issuer continues to take steps to give effect to the restructuring of the Issuer and its 12.0% senior secured notes due 2025 (the ""Notes"") as contemplated by the Restructuring Support Agreement entered into between the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries and approximately 81% of holders of the Notes, dated <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2</span>, 2021.&nbsp; The restructuring of the Issuer is expected to be implemented through a pre-packaged Chapter 11 process.&nbsp; For further details, please refer to the Previous Announcements. This announcement relates to SeaMex Ltd. and has no relation to Seadrill Limited's plan of reorganisation (the ""Plan"") and therefore does not impact the recoveries existing shareholders of Seadrill Limited will receive under the Plan. Consummation of the Plan is subject to a number of customary terms and conditions, including court approval, which was obtained on <span class=""xn-chron"">October 26, 2021</span>.

The event will take place <span class=""xn-chron"">November 1</span>, 3 and 9, 2021 at the same time as the United Nation's <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span> Summit. Two of the panels taking place on <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 3</span> from <span class=""xn-chron"">11:00 AM -12:30 PM ET</span> will focus on the actions state insurance regulators are taking on climate risks and resiliency, including coordination through the NAIC. The UNEP PSI <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span> Sustainable Insurance Series is intended to be the most comprehensive event for the insurance industry during <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span> and aims to further raise climate risk engagement and share insights among insurance supervisors.&nbsp;  Panelists include: <span class=""xn-person"">David Altmaier</span>, NAIC President and Florida Insurance Commissioner; <span class=""xn-person"">Kathleen Birrane</span>, Maryland Insurance Commissioner; <span class=""xn-person"">Ray Farmer</span>, Director, South Carolina Department of Insurance; <span class=""xn-person"">Mike Kreidler</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Washington</span> Commissioner of Insurance; <span class=""xn-person"">Ricardo Lara</span>, California Department of Insurance Commissioner; and <span class=""xn-person"">Andrew Mais</span>, NAIC Secretary-Treasurer and Connecticut Insurance Commissioner.  ""When it comes to climate risk and resiliency, there's critical work being done in every state. And it's an issue that state insurance regulators have prioritized for decades,"" explains <span class=""xn-person"">Mike Consedine</span>, CEO of the NAIC. ""State insurance regulators have long been on the front lines of climate-related natural catastrophe preparedness and response, protecting policyholders and maintaining well-functioning insurance markets. We're very excited to participate in this event to share our work and learn from others.""  State insurance regulators and the NAIC have an extensive history focused on managing the risks faced by the insurance industry and consumers. This includes addressing how natural hazards impact the solvency of insureds as well as the affordability and availability of insurance. In 2020, the organization and its members created a Climate and Resiliency Task Force, recognizing the challenges, risks and opportunities faced by the entire insurance industry and the importance of engaging all states on climate-related risk and resiliency issues. Current and future efforts build on decades of experience managing the economic fallout of natural disasters. State insurance regulators are better able to tackle this multi-generational issue by working collectively and sharing experiences, both at the domestic and international levels, to work toward a safer, more resilient future.&nbsp;&nbsp; The agenda for the PSI <span class=""xn-money"">COP26</span> Sustainable Insurance Series agenda can be found <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3345095-1&amp;h=2206180633&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unepfi.org%2Fpsi%2Fthe_psi_cop26_sustainable_insurance_series%2F&amp;a=here"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.  <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3345095-1&amp;h=1453644571&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brighttalk.com%2Fwebcast%2F17290%2F515080%3Futm_source%3DUNEnvironmentFinanceInitiative%26utm_medium%3Dbrighttalk%26utm_campaign%3D515080&amp;a=Register"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Register</a><b>&nbsp;for the panel: How are U.S. insurance regulators taking action on climate change?</b> About NAIC As part of our state-based system of insurance regulation in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>, the NAIC provides expertise, data, and analysis for insurance commissioners to effectively regulate the industry and protect consumers.

Though DeciBio has a relatively small carbon footprint, it generates carbon emissions due to its two offices (in <span class=""xn-location"">Los Angeles</span> and the Bay Area), airline travel, commuting, and other operations. As stated by co-founder <span class=""xn-person"">David Cavanaugh</span>, ""<i>I have always believed that companies can be agents of positive social change, often ahead of governments and other organizations. Climate change due to carbon emissions is wreaking havoc on the planet and humankind. Thus, we must act quickly to understand and reflect upon our impact as well as actively contribute to environmental restoration. We urge our clients and peer organizations to join us in this important first step.</i>""&nbsp; To help accomplish this carbon neutral goal, DeciBio is partnering with My Forest Armenia (MFA), a nonprofit organization that plants trees and funds scientific research. DeciBio selected MFA due to their: 1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commitment to planting and nurturing trees – versus merely planting seeds<br class=""dnr"">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full allocation of funds to reforestation – MFA covers all administrative costs <br class=""dnr"">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientific approach and team – which includes 2 PhDs Andre Gumuchdjian, Founder of MFA, stated, ""<i>I am very happy with DeciBio's decision and long-term commitment; people need to urgently understand the crucial importance of forests. From providing oxygen to ensuring a steady supply of fresh water, forests are indispensible for sustaining human life.""&nbsp;</i>&nbsp; Through MFA, DeciBio will plant thousands of trees in a DeciBio dedicated forest, starting in late 2021. These trees will remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the air, release three times more oxygen than CO<sub>2</sub> captured, help lower global air temperatures, prevent soil erosion, and increase biodiversity.&nbsp; <br class=""dnr""> <i>""While DeciBio helps drive cutting edge changes in precision medicine, environmental determinants of health will continue to disproportionately impact some communities more than others. Fighting for a more sustainable world helps to ensure a future with more equitable&nbsp;health outcomes.

 The Surgical Care Coalition urges Congress to stop the harmful Medicare cuts that will take effect in less than two months and will limit patient access to needed care; Majority of the U.S. House supports stopping the cuts News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 17:30 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">WASHINGTON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) final rule released today by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) doubles down on the harmful 3.75 percent cut to surgeons and surgical practices that will harm patient access to care, which has already been significantly impacted by the pandemic, argues the Surgical Care Coalition.  ""Amid the ongoing pandemic, it's critical now more than ever, to protect patients by stopping these cuts and working toward a long-term solution to stabilize the health care system,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">John K. Ratliff</span>, MD, American Association of Neurological Surgeon/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Washington Committee Chair. ""Patients have already delayed important preventative care like cancer screenings due to COVID-19. These cuts will further delay care to our nation's seniors."" This 3.75 percent cut combined with automatic Medicare cuts will slash Medicare payments to surgeons by nearly nine percent, beginning <span class=""xn-chron"">January 1, 2022</span>. As COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have already caused Americans to delay needed care, these cuts will continue to strain health care systems nationwide.&nbsp;  ""Our patients put their trust in us to provide them the best care, but it's becoming increasingly clear that they cannot trust the system that's supposed to be set up to support them,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">David B. Hoyt</span>, MD, FACS, American College of Surgeons Executive Director. ""These Medicare cuts will further exacerbate our pandemic-strained health care system and cause further delay in care to the patients who need it most."" Representatives <span class=""xn-person"">Ami Bera</span>, MD (D-Calif.) and <span class=""xn-person"">Larry Bucshon</span>, MD (R-Ind.) recently led a bipartisan letter to Speaker of the House of Representatives <span class=""xn-person"">Nancy Pelosi</span> (D-Calif.) and House Minority Leader <span class=""xn-person"">Kevin McCarthy</span> (R-Calif.), signed by 247 U.S. Representatives and supported by 135 national medical groups, urging them to stop these harmful cuts. In these next few weeks, the Surgical Care Coalition will continue to advocate for Congress to protect patients and the care they need.&nbsp;  ""Despite hospital overcrowding, a health professional shortage, a backlog of some 5 million surgical cases and a fragile recovery from COVID-19, CMS chose to finalize policies that will further jeopardize patient access to surgical care,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">John H. Calhoon</span>, MD, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons First Vice President. ""Our health system is already stressed to the breaking point. We urge Congress to intervene for the sake of our patients."" ""Over the past few years, ophthalmologists and other surgeons have faced Medicare payment uncertainty and drastic payment cuts, which have profoundly affected our ability to run our practices and care for patients,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">George A. Williams</span>, MD, American Academy of Ophthalmology Senior Secretary for Advocacy. ""As expected, the release of CMS' final 2022 fee schedule will again necessitate Congressional intervention to stop the payment cuts this year. We will continue to urge Congress to seek long-term solutions for physician payment reform."" ""As vascular surgeons we provide comprehensive care to a predominantly elderly, sick, and vulnerable population,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Ali AbuRahma</span>, MD, Society for Vascular Surgery President. ""These cuts will further strain a health care system already on the brink of breaking, and will place the neediest patients in the greatest jeopardy for losing access to medically necessary services."" ""In light of the pandemic's negative impact on medical practices, further cuts to physician reimbursement pose an unsustainable risk to patient access to care,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Richard S. Hoffman</span>, MD, American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery President. ""This is especially true for patients receiving sight-restoring cataract surgery, one of the most successful and frequently performed procedures for Medicare beneficiaries."" ""These cuts to surgical care harm patients by limiting resources and availability of highly trained quality surgeons. The continued erosion of specialty care through these policies not only harm the physician that provides the care but also the patient,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Christopher A. Reeder</span>, D.O., FACOS, FACS, American College of Osteopathic Surgeons President.

 Blending a barrel-aged Imperial Rye Ale with a New England Rye IPA, these two mainstays of the New England craft alcohol community created a barrel-aged IPA for both beer and whiskey lovers alike News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 17:29 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">BOSTON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;Following the release of two successful barrel-aged collaborations across just as many years, <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344645-1&amp;h=2026848397&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fharpoonbrewery.com%2F&amp;a=Harpoon+Brewery"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harpoon Brewery</a> is announcing its third collaboration with <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344645-1&amp;h=1845093415&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwhistlepigwhiskey.com%2F&amp;a=WhistlePig+Whiskey"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WhistlePig Whiskey</a>: <b>Harpoon</b> <b>Green Mountain Ryed</b>— a hop-forward take on a barrel-aged beer.  
 This ""blended"" New England Rye IPA marries a barrel-aged Imperial Rye Ale with a New England Rye IPA, both brewed with WhistlePig's own estate-grown Rye. ""Barrel-Aged IPAs"" can be a tough concept to nail. While time is a friend of barrel-aged beers thanks to greater transfer of flavor from the wood, it is the enemy of IPAs as aging hop oils break down and lose potency. To remedy the situation and create a perfectly balanced liquid, Harpoon elected to brew two base beers and blend them together.  ""The history of blending barrel-aged beers goes back centuries, but we've never heard of a beer like this that balances barrel and hops so perfectly,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Dan Kenary</span>, CEO and co-founder of Harpoon Brewery. ""While working with WhistlePig on this latest release, we wanted to challenge ourselves to create a barrel-aged beer that still drank like a New England IPA. The result is both flavorful and complex – and hopefully gives hop fans and whiskey drinkers something to enjoy together this holiday season."" To create this unique brew, a high-gravity Rye Ale was aged in freshly emptied WhistlePig PiggyBack 100% Rye barrels for 12 weeks, capturing the true essence of whiskey made from 100% Rye. Harpoon then brewed a fresh, heavily dry-hopped New England Rye IPA featuring some classic citrus-heavy hops. After the barrels were emptied, the two were blended into one beer in a 35 aged/65 fresh ratio. The resulting 7% ABV hazy IPA achieves the best of both worlds with super refreshing citrus and tropical fruit notes accompanying that warming, comforting rye whiskey spice. ""We had worked with Harpoon to craft barrel-aged beers in the past, but it was a unique challenge to pick the right barrel for something like a hazy IPA. Our PiggyBack 100% Rye Whiskey is made with a mashbill of 100% Rye and has these wonderful notes of both citrus and spice that seemed like a great pairing for tropical or citrusy hops. We couldn't be happier with Green Mountain Ryed – it's a one-of-a-kind take on a barrel-aged beer that managed to not sacrifice any of the fresh hopped flavor of the IPA while gently layering in the spice and oak of 100% Rye Whiskey,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Meghan Ireland</span>, Whiskey Blender at WhistlePig.  Harpoon's Green Mountain Ryed is a limited release for the month of November and will be sold in 4-packs of 16 oz. cans. It will also be available on draft starting this month at Harpoon's <span class=""xn-location"">Boston</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Vermont</span> breweries.

When the Brewery was founded, Harpoon was issued Brewing Permit #001 by the Commonwealth of <span class=""xn-location"">Massachusetts</span>, since it was the first to brew commercially in <span class=""xn-location"">Boston</span> after a dormant period of about 25 years. Harpoon's line of craft beer features its award-winning IPA and seasonal beers, along with special limited releases. In 2014, Harpoon became an employee-owned company. <b>About WhistlePig Whiskey <br class=""dnr""></b>Founded in 2007, WhistlePig has become the #1 distiller in the ultra-premium and luxury Rye Whiskey category in <span class=""xn-location"">North America</span>, featuring the bold and often untapped flavor of Rye. WhistlePig is leading a surge of innovation in the emerging field of North American whiskey.

With the opening of its distillery on its 500-acre <span class=""xn-location"">Vermont</span> farm in the fall of 2015, WhistlePig has also become one of the leading farm-to-bottle Rye whiskeys in the world.

The <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344988-1&amp;h=459227439&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aspca.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fusda_complaint_dg.pdf&amp;a=complaint"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">complaint</a>&nbsp;against Gingerich, filed by the DOJ, detailed horrific conditions at multiple locations in <span class=""xn-location"">Iowa</span> where Gingerich kept dogs, including dead dogs, dogs with untreated injuries and illnesses, like parvo and distemper, dogs with painful fur matting, dogs in cages that were too small, and moldy food.  The ARL is overseeing the rescue operation and sheltering, medical needs and care of the animals, while partnering with the ASPCA who is assisting in operational planning, field removal and medical care, as well as supporting veterinary forensic exams, transport, legal and investigative assistance, and providing essential emergency sheltering supplies. The Animal Rescue Corps, Bissell Pet Foundation, First Medical Inc., Hills Foundation, <span class=""xn-org"">Iowa State University</span>, RedRover, Wayside Waifs and Wisconsin Humane Society will also support this case by providing responders to assist with transporting and providing daily care, food and supplies for the animals.

Since then, more than 200 additional dogs and puppies have been rescued over the course of several days as the removal efforts continue. The dogs that have remained on the properties throughout the process have and continue to receive daily care. <b><i><span class=""xn-person"">Tom Colvin</span>, CEO at the Animal Rescue League of <span class=""xn-location"">Iowa</span></i></b>&nbsp;stated, ""The light is shining on bad actors in the dog breeding industry as a result of this action by the Department of Justice. A new approach of stopping them before animals suffer is long overdue. We are thankful to all our partners in putting an end to this operation specifically, and we look forward to making this a step toward large-scale change."" ""We are grateful to the Department of Justice for taking action to finally remove hundreds of animals from the horrifying cruelty and neglect that they were left to suffer in at the hands of this USDA licensed breeder,"" said <b><i><span class=""xn-person"">Robert Hensley</span>, Legal Advocacy Senior Counsel for the ASPCA</i></b>. ""This shocking cruelty is a predictable result of the USDA's customer service policy through which they substitute education and cooperation for enforcement, allowing the very animals they have a legal and moral obligation to protect to endure prolonged and extreme suffering. We thank Animal Rescue League of <span class=""xn-location"">Iowa</span> for stepping up to remove these animals from harm's way, and we are proud to support their efforts.""&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Our hearts broke when we learned of the situation so many dogs are living through."" said <b><i><span class=""xn-person"">Geoff Hall</span>, Wayside Waifs' President</i></b>, ""But thanks to donor support, we're extremely grateful to have the ability to help our animal welfare colleagues save these dogs' lives.""

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 17:25 ET Share this article <b>- El rendimiento de Daewoong ""Saltos y límites"" en el tercer trimestre supera los 20.000 millones de KRW en ingresos operativos durante tres trimestres consecutivos</b> SEÚL, <span class=""xn-person"">Corea del</span> sur, 2 de noviembre de 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Daewoong Pharmaceutical (Daewoong) (consejero delegado: <span class=""xn-person"">Sengho Jeon</span>) anunció su rendimiento de gestión (consolidado) para el tercer trimestre de 2021. Las ventas registraron 290.600 millones de KRW, lo que representa un aumento interanual del 5%. Los ingresos operativos y la ganancia neta registraron 22.700 millones de KRW y 12.000 millones de KRW, respectivamente, lo que representa un aumento interanual de casi cuatro veces. Al comparar los ingresos operativos acumulados hasta el tercer trimestre, Daewoong experimentó un aumento interanual de 7,6 veces de 8.300 millones de KRW a 63.400 millones de KRW. Daewoong obtuvo 20.000 millones de KRW en ingresos operativos durante tres trimestres consecutivos y se espera que alcance cerca de 90.000 millones de KRW este año. En el tercer trimestre, las exportaciones de medicamentos de prescripción de venta libre (ETC) alcanzaron cerca de 200.000 millones de KRW, lo que demuestra una vez más el estatus de Daewoong como la potencia del sector ETC. Nabota también logró ventas de 20.000 millones de KRW y espera un fuerte crecimiento. Los medicamentos de venta libre (OTC) también tuvieron logros en el negocio de alimentos funcionales saludables. Basado en la consolidación, Daewoong registró 265.100 millones de KRW en ventas y 23.900 millones de KRW en ingresos operativos. Las ventas de ETC fueron de 174.900 millones de KRW en el tercer trimestre del año anterior, y 188.900 millones de KRW en el mismo trimestre del año pasado. Las ventas en el sector de ETC aumentaron nuevamente un 4,1% en el tercer trimestre de este año, alcanzando un récord de 196.700 millones de KRW. Si bien mantuvieron ventas sustanciales en general, los productos de Daewoong con alta rentabilidad, incluidos Diabex, Crezet y Luphere, se expandieron considerablemente y lograron altos ingresos operativos. Las ventas acumuladas en el tercer trimestre crecieron un 8% interanual. Las ventas de Nabota en el tercer trimestre de este año se duplicaron interanualmente de 11.300 millones a 20.900 millones de KRW. Las ventas continuaron mostrando la tendencia habitual de crecimiento en los principales canales de ventas (es decir, los mercados de EE. UU. y Corea), y obtuvieron buenos resultados en Brasil, Tailandia y México. Las ventas acumuladas en el tercer trimestre crecieron un 85,7% interanual. En el sector OTC, las ventas aumentaron un 3,3% alcanzando los 30.000 millones de KRW desde los 29.100 millones de KRW en el tercer trimestre del año pasado. Los OTC convencionales como Ursa (OTC) e Impactamin han mostrado ventas constantes, mientras que las ventas de alimentos funcionales saludables han aumentado. Daewoong espera fortalecer aún más su impulso de crecimiento con los nuevos lanzamientos de medicamentos del próximo año. Dado que Fexuprazan y Nabota han sido reconocidos por su valor operativo sustancial, se lanzarán en Corea y en los mercados europeos, respectivamente, el próximo año. La tecnología para Fexuprazan ya se ha exportado en una escala de 1,1 billones de KRW a nivel mundial, y Nabota es la única toxina botulínica en <span class=""xn-location"">Asia</span> que ha sido aprobada por la Administración de Fármacos y Alimentos de EE. UU. (FDA) y planea presentar una Solicitud de Licencia de Biológicos (BLA) en <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> durante este año. Los ensayos clínicos para indicaciones de tratamiento en EE. UU. también avanzan sin problemas. El consejero delegado <span class=""xn-person"">Sengho Jeon de Daewoong</span> dijo: ""La innovación continua en I+D, la inversión y la expansión de ventas basadas en la estrategia de verificación de marketing de cuatro fases están conduciendo a un crecimiento del rendimiento. Planeamos continuar fortaleciendo nuestro impulso de crecimiento lanzando Nabota en Europa el próximo año junto con Fexuprazan en Corea, que superó el billón de KRW en exportaciones de tecnología"".

During the fourth quarter, the Company plans to buyback shares equivalent to 25% of its third quarter free cash flow less base dividend payments, or approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$111 million</span>. <b>Continued Net Debt Reduction</b>&nbsp; <br class=""dnr"">During the third quarter, Ovintiv reduced net debt by <span class=""xn-money"">$409 million</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$4.8 billion</span>. The Company remains on track to reach its year-end net debt target of <span class=""xn-money"">$4.5 billion</span>, which will represent approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$3 billion</span> of net debt reduction since the second quarter of 2020. During the quarter, the Company set a new net debt target of <span class=""xn-money"">$3 billion</span>, which, assuming current strip commodity prices, could be achieved as soon as year-end 2022.

The combined redemptions represent approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$1.1 billion</span> of debt repayments, resulting in expected annualized interest savings of over <span class=""xn-money"">$50 million</span>. At the end of the third quarter, the Company had no outstanding balances under its revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs. Ovintiv's available liquidity totaled <span class=""xn-money"">$4.3 billion</span>. <b>Dividend Declared <br class=""dnr""></b>On <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2, 2021</span>, Ovintiv's Board declared a dividend of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.14</span> per share of common stock payable on <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2021</span>, to common stockholders of record as of <span class=""xn-chron"">December 15</span>, 2021.The dividend was increased by approximately 50% in the third quarter.  <b>ESG Performance <br class=""dnr""></b>The Company recently announced the achievement of several key sustainability milestones related to emissions reductions, social responsibility and corporate governance.

With capital investment of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$1.5 billion</span> in 2022, the Company expects to maintain crude and condensate production volumes consistent with the second half of 2021, at approximately 180 to 190 Mbbls/d. This range reflects a largely flat year-over-year production profile when including the impact of asset divestitures which closed during the first half of 2021. Ovintiv did not enter 2021 with a material drilled-but-uncompleted (DUC) well inventory nor does it expect to exit the year with a material number of DUC wells. ""We are confident in our ability to maintain our capital efficiency in 2022,"" said McCracken. ""Our teams have been relentless in finding ways to offset cost inflation and make better wells. Our Permian, Anadarko, and <span class=""xn-location"">Montney</span> assets are all generating superior returns on invested capital as evidenced by the fact that each asset is on track to generate between <span class=""xn-money"">$1.0</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$1.1 billion</span> of upstream operating free cash flow in 2021. Our multi-basin portfolio, repeatable load-leveled program, pacesetter cost performance, and rigorous supply chain management provide a strong position to continue delivering industry leading capital efficiency as we head into 2022."" <b>Asset Highlights <br class=""dnr""></b>Ovintiv continued to demonstrate industry-leading capital efficiencies across its Core 3 assets during the third quarter. Despite inflationary pressures, program-leading, or ""pacesetter"" well cost performance was repeated in each of the three assets during the quarter. <b>Permian <br class=""dnr""></b>Permian production averaged 126 MBOE/d (81% liquids) in the quarter. The Company averaged three gross rigs, drilled 17 net wells, and had 20 net wells turned in line (TIL).  Permian drilling and completion (D&amp;C) costs have averaged <span class=""xn-money"">$480</span> per foot year-to-date and are 11% lower than the 2020 program average. During the quarter, the 13 well Falcon East development in Midland County had an average lateral length of 13,500 feet, was drilled at an average rate of over 2,000 feet per day and was completed using simul-frac at a rate of over 3,300 feet per day. Completion efficiency for all 20 net TILs in the quarter averaged over 3,000 feet per day, with 95% of these wells completed using simul-frac. In addition, three of the five pads brought online during the quarter used 100% local, wet sand, generating savings of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$100,000</span> per well.  <b>Anadarko <br class=""dnr""></b>Anadarko production averaged 134 MBOE/d (62% liquids) in the quarter. The Company averaged two gross rigs, drilled 12 net wells, and had 10 net wells TIL. In the STACK area, D&amp;C costs have averaged <span class=""xn-money"">$430</span> per foot year-to-date and are 10% lower than the 2020 program average. In addition to achieving best in class D&amp;C costs, year-to-date 2021 STACK well results have demonstrated a significant uplift in performance, driven by enhanced artificial lift and optimized completion design.  The Anadarko team lowered facility costs in the quarter to approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$300,000</span> per well, 27% below the 2020 program average. This cost reduction was driven by development optimization, including an increase in the number of wells drilled per pad and efficiently reoccupying older locations.  <b><span class=""xn-location"">Montney</span><br class=""dnr""></b><span class=""xn-location"">Montney</span> production averaged 229 MBOE/d (25% liquids) in the quarter. The Company averaged four gross rigs, drilled 23 net wells and had 16 net wells TIL.&nbsp;  <span class=""xn-location"">Montney</span> year-to-date D&amp;C costs have averaged <span class=""xn-money"">$410</span> per foot and are 9% lower than the 2020 program average. During the quarter, Ovintiv drilled three of its longest laterals ever in the <span class=""xn-location"">Montney</span>. The longest of these was drilled at over 15,300 feet, 13% more than the previous company record. Industry wide, these wells mark three of the top five longest laterals drilled in the basin to date. About 90% of the completed wells in the quarter utilized an optimized casing design that saved approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$120,000</span> per well. The 2021 Montney program is achieving better than expected well performance across all fluid windows. In the liquids-rich fairway of <span class=""xn-location"">Pipestone</span>, the 8 well 16-27 development has produced an average of 993 BOE/d (63% condensate) per well over the first 180 days of production.  <b>Base Assets<br class=""dnr""></b>Bakken production averaged 25 MBOE/d (80% liquids) in the quarter. The Company averaged one net rig, drilled four net wells and had two net wells TIL. The Bakken program is continuing to demonstrate exceptional performance through optimized completion and wellbore designs. The Kestrel 3 well development has achieved an IP120 production rate of 1,330 barrels of oil per day per well. &nbsp;&nbsp; For additional information, please refer to the 3Q 2021 Results Presentation at <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344678-1&amp;h=2898778327&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.ovintiv.com%2Fpresentations-events&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.ovintiv.com%2Fpresentations-events"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://investor.ovintiv.com/presentations-events</a>. <b>Conference Call Information<br class=""dnr""></b>A conference call and webcast to discuss the Company's third quarter results will be held at <span class=""xn-chron"">9:00 a.m. MT</span> (<span class=""xn-chron"">11:00 a.m. ET</span>) on <span class=""xn-chron"">November 3, 2021</span>.

 U.S.-Based Wellness Tech Company Neuvana Expands its Footprint Overseas, Marking Another Step in the Company's Growing Global Launch News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 17:12 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- U.S.-based Neuvana LLC, a wellness company and leader in neuroscience technology, announces the much-anticipated release of its new product, Xen, is now available to consumers in the 27 countries that make up the European Union and <span class=""xn-location"">United Kingdom</span>. This is the next step in the company's international launch, which started shipping to <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> last month and expects to add more countries in the coming months. Xen by Neuvana is a pocket-sized device that connects to your mobile phone through an app and sends a gentle electrical signal through patented earbuds to stimulate the vagus nerve in the ear. Invented by a leading cardiac surgeon and supported by science, Xen's innovative design targets the vagus nerve, the longest cranial nerve in the body, which acts as the information highway from the brain to most of the body's major organs. When stimulated, the vagus nerve activates the parasympathetic nervous system by signaling the brain to release calming neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine. This natural chemical process can help the body feel calmer, more focused, increase mood, and achieve better sleep too. ""We have had an outpouring of interest from consumers outside of the U.S. wanting to try Xen and experience the health benefits users have shared that improve their day-to-day lifestyle,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Vince Manopoli</span>, CEO of Neuvana. ""We are excited to continue to expand the company's footprint to our friends overseas and deliver Xen into the hands of people who are looking for alternative ways to manage the health impact of stress, anxiety, and poor sleep "" Initially launched in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> in 2019, Xen was specifically designed to meet the high standards of product safety testing and certification in order to bring the product to consumers overseas. It has earned the esteemed CE marked certification, which applies to products intended for the European market that have been tested and found to comply with each country's high safety requirements. ""With the safety of our customers always at the forefront, we continue to work diligently to meet the most stringent guidelines for our products according to each country's specific requirements,"" said Manopoli. ""Furthermore, it's important to us that we do so without compromising the product's health benefits or diminishing the overall customer experience.

The term ""vagus"" is named after the Latin word for ""wandering,"" as it starts at the brain, and travels near the ear, and on to every major organ in the body. As a result, it controls a vast range of functions and communicates sensory information between the brain and the organs. The vagus nerve is crucial for activating the body's relaxation response and helping to regulate tension. Just like a muscle, when toned or strengthened regularly, the functions of the vagus nerve can be amplified and its response can help a person recover quicker from stressful events. <b>Backed by Research</b> Neuvana is considered a leader in neuroscience technology, specifically in the vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) category. As a company, its focus is centered around pairing neuroscience and technology to develop innovative products to better people's health and everyday lifestyle. As part of this process, Neuvana is involved in research surrounding VNS with the following institutions: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), <span class=""xn-org"">University of Maryland</span>, <span class=""xn-org"">Thomas Jefferson University</span> Hospital, Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center, among others.  <b>About Neuvana LLC</b>  Neuvana, LLC is a <span class=""xn-location"">South Florida</span>-based company at the intersection of wellness and technology, with a focus on Neuroscience.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 17:12 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">WASHINGTON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;AARP CEO <span class=""xn-person"">Jo Ann Jenkins</span> issued the following statement reacting to the announcement of a deal to lower prescription drug costs: <i>""There's no greater issue affecting the pocketbooks of seniors on Medicare than the ever-increasing costs of prescription drugs. For decades, seniors have been at the mercy of Big Pharma. Allowing Medicare to finally negotiate drug prices is a big win for seniors. Preventing prices from rising faster than inflation and adding a hard out-of-pocket cap to Part D will provide real relief for seniors with the highest drug costs. Lawmakers must work quickly to turn today's announcement into a legislative reality that delivers on the promises made to older Americans.</i> <i>""AARP members have called and emailed Congress more than 1.5 million times this year, with more than 300,000 emails and 9,000 phone calls into Member offices in the last few days alone. </i> <i>""AARP applauds the leaders in Congress who have fought so hard for so long to get to this point. As we have said many times before, the details matter. We will closely examine the proposal to ensure drug prices and out-of-pocket costs for seniors will finally come down as a result of this deal.</i> <i>""Now it is time for Congress to deliver for their constituents by passing a Build Back Better Act that will truly lower their prescription drug prices and improve the lives of millions of older Americans. We will not stop until the President signs legislation that lowers drug prices.""</i> <b><u>About AARP<br class=""dnr""></u></b><i>AARP is the nation's largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to empowering people 50 and older to choose how they live as they age.

""I am also very excited about the work our team is doing in energy transition to provide solutions for other companies to reduce their carbon footprints, as well as to address our own emissions footprint.

We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (less) interest expense, net of interest income; depreciation and amortization; impairments; (income) loss from unconsolidated affiliate investments; distributions from unconsolidated affiliate investments; (gain) loss on disposition of assets; (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt; unit-based compensation; income tax expense (benefit); unrealized (gain) loss on commodity swaps; costs associated with the relocation of processing facilities; accretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations; transaction costs; (non-cash rent); and (non-controlling interest share of adjusted EBITDA from joint ventures). We define free cash flow after distributions as adjusted EBITDA, net to ENLC, plus (less) (growth and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding capital expenditures that were contributed by other entities and relate to the non-controlling interest share of our consolidated entities); (interest expense, net of interest income); (distributions declared on common units); (accrued cash distributions on Series B Preferred Units and Series C Preferred Units paid or expected to be paid); (costs associated with the relocation of processing facilities); non-cash interest (income)/expense; (payments to terminate interest rate swaps); (current income taxes); and proceeds from the sale of equipment and land. We define segment cash flow as segment profit less growth and maintenance capital expenditures, which are gross to EnLink prior to giving effect to the contributions by other entities related to the non-controlling interest share of our consolidated entities. EnLink believes these measures are useful to investors because they may provide users of this financial information with meaningful comparisons between current results and previously-reported results and a meaningful measure of the company's cash flow after it has satisfied the capital and related requirements of its operations. In addition, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow after distributions are both used as metrics in our short-term incentive program for compensating employees. Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow after distributions, and segment cash flow, as defined above, are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. They should not be considered in isolation or as an indicator of EnLink's performance. Furthermore, they should not be seen as a substitute for metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the following tables. See ENLC's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more information.  <b>Other definitions and explanations of terms used in this press release:<br class=""dnr""></b>Segment profit (loss) is defined as revenues, less cost of sales (exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization), less operating expenses. Segment profit (loss) includes non-cash compensation expenses reflected in operating expenses. See ""Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 - Segment Information"" in ENLC's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2020, and, when available, ""Item 1.

India crane market size will be valued at <span class=""xn-money"">USD 1.3 billion</span>, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.56% by volume during 2021-2027 The impact of low interest rates on the construction industry has been significant. Buyers of construction equipment in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span> have boosted their confidence in renewing their fleets. Furthermore, since 2017, public investment has increased. The Indian government is also taking a lot of initiatives to fund the infrastructure of the country. Additionally, the country's well-developed administration and independent judicial system and its large geography make it a resource repository. <b>VENDOR LANDSCAPE</b> The vendor's ability to finance the purchasing of parts and components required to manufacture is inspired by purchasing power of contractors. New advancements in technology and facilities are expected to boost the production and product portfolio for the vendors operating in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>. The investment ratio of 51:49 joint venture between Tadano and Escorts will enable both partners to improve their current and future capabilities in the segment worldwide. <b>INDIA CRANE MARKET INSIGHTS</b> In 2019, India became the 15th leading exporter of cranes in the world. This position will improve in the forecast period as the government plans to spend money on infrastructure to grow the country's manufacturing sector. Automated safety features added recently in the products will provide players a significant edge over other players. In India, the rental business is rising rapidly. With most OEMs offering rental services in this space, the major part of the rental equipment market in <span class=""xn-location"">India</span> is dominated by unorganized players. <b>KEY HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE REPORT</b> Over the last three to four years, the Indian crane market has witnessed growth fueled by government initiatives such as the Macron Law. India's exports slowed down because of the pandemic in <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2020</span>. But there will be growth in coming years due to the recovery of the US, <span class=""xn-location"">Japan</span>, and <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> markets which are the crucial trade partners of India. <b>INDIA CRANE MARKET SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS</b> A rough terrain crane is preferred due to its compact frame. They are suitable for navigating through and lifting in confined areas. The construction of the Gujarat International finance Tec-city (GIFT city) boosts the development of new projects in the region.

The Company expects the transaction to close later this year, pending regulatory approval. ""For the past several months there has been significant interest on behalf of larger vertically-integrated operators to acquire our <span class=""xn-location"">Phoenix</span> dispensary,"" said Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer, <span class=""xn-person"">Kyle Kingsley</span>, M.D. ""Given our presence as a predominantly wholesale supplier of biomass in the <span class=""xn-location"">Arizona</span> market, our management team and board of directors felt that this transaction simplified our business during a period in which we're prioritizing resources toward the attractive opportunities we see in our other markets, especially <span class=""xn-location"">New York</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Minnesota</span>.""  The transaction also includes related cultivation licenses for both medical and adult-use, only one of which is currently operational at the Company's 18-acre outdoor farm in <span class=""xn-location"">Amado, AZ</span>, south of <span class=""xn-location"">Tucson</span>.

Kingsley concluded, ""We originally acquired our <span class=""xn-location"">Arizona</span> operations in 2019, along with several other cultivation sites in the <span class=""xn-location"">Southwestern United States</span>, because we were attracted to strategic geographic locations with climates that were suitable for outdoor cultivation. We've since developed what we believe is one of the lowest-cost outdoor cultivation facilities in <span class=""xn-location"">Amado</span>, and we're pleased to continue operating that facility and servicing the wholesale market in <span class=""xn-location"">Arizona</span> through our management services agreement."" <b>About Goodness Growth Holdings, Inc.</b> Goodness Growth Holdings, Inc., is a physician-led, science-focused holding company whose mission is to bring the power of plants to the world.

However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers funds from operations (""FFO"") and adjusted funds from operations (""AFFO"") to be appropriate measures of operating performance of an equity real estate investment trust (""REIT""). In particular, the Company believes that AFFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company's operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and other events.&nbsp; </span> &nbsp; <span class=""prnews_span"">The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Inc. (""NAREIT"") definition of FFO. FFO and FFO per share are operating performance measures adopted by NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a REIT's operating performance equal to net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate properties, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. NAREIT also provides REITs with an option to exclude gains, losses and impairments of assets that are incidental to the main business of the REIT from the calculation of FFO.</span> &nbsp; <span class=""prnews_span"">In addition to FFO, the Company presents AFFO and AFFO per share. The Company defines AFFO as FFO, excluding certain expenses related to closing costs of properties acquired accounted for as business combinations and mortgages funded, excluding straight-line rent and the amortization of stock-based compensation, and including or excluding other non-cash items from time to time. AFFO presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition.&nbsp; </span> &nbsp; <span class=""prnews_span"">FFO and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company's financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company's liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO and AFFO should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented elsewhere herein.</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(2)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for FFO and AFFO are calculated based on the treasury method, rather than the 2-class method used to calculate earnings per share.</span> CONTACT:&nbsp; <span class=""xn-person"">David H.

lift truck market continued to grow in the 2021 third quarter, increasing approximately 23% over the prior year quarter but at a more moderate pace than in the first half of the year. Compared with the 2021 second quarter, the market decreased more than 14% due to downturns in all markets except <span class=""xn-location"">Latin America</span>. In the third quarter of 2021, bookings increased significantly compared with the prior year third quarter due to a higher market as a result of increased economic activity, share gains, long lead times and the pull forward of orders ahead of price increases, but were lower than the record levels experienced in the second quarter of 2021. Despite continued high bookings levels, unit shipments were only modestly higher than the 2021 second quarter due to significant component shortages caused by ongoing global supply chain and logistics constraints. These factors led to a large increase in backlog compared with the 2021 second quarter, and to a new historically high backlog level, which has extended delivery lead times substantially. The average bookings sales price per unit increased compared with the 2021 second quarter and the prior-year quarter because the Company continued to increase prices to offset material and freight cost inflation. The increase in prices also translated into a modest increase in the current average sales price per unit of backlog compared with the 2021 second quarter, but the average value decreased from the prior year third quarter because of a change in the mix of products due in part to a significant increase in orders for lower-priced trucks in the Americas over the past year.  Throughout the first nine months of the year, the Company's ability to ship product was significantly constrained by parts shortages. These shortages, which worsened in the third quarter, arose due to shipping space availability in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, congestion at U.S. ports and a shortage of trucks available to move the goods once they are received at U.S. ports as a result of a general lack of truck availability and labor shortages. All of these factors have limited the Company's ability to receive parts at their originally scheduled times. The Company has put significant effort into securing components through other channels including different shipping methods and other vendors. However, the limited availability of alternative shipping methods and the build-to-order, highly configured nature of the Company's components means that alternative vendors that can provide the necessary components are very limited, and therefore counteracting these constraints successfully is very difficult.  Despite these component shortage, revenues in the Lift Truck segment increased 13.8% in the third quarter of 2021 over the third quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of higher unit and parts volumes, mainly due to a 2,600 unit increase in shipments in all classes except Class 1 electric trucks. Favorable currency movements of <span class=""xn-money"">$6.7 million</span> and the favorable effect of price increases put in place to mitigate the impact of material and freight cost inflation also contributed to the improvement in Lift Truck revenues. <b><i><u>Geographic Segment Results</u></i></b> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>(in millions, except units)</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Americas**</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>EMEA**</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>JAPIC**</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b><u>Q3&nbsp;2021</u></b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><u>Q3 2020</u></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b><u>Q3 2021</u></b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><u>Q3 2020</u></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b><u>Q3 2021</u></b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><u>Q3 2020</u></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Unit Shipments</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>13,700</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">12,000</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>6,200</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">5,400</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>3,300</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">3,200</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Revenues</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>494.3</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">426.9</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>153.4</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">143.8</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>56.1</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">48.0</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Gross Profit </span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>44.5</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">65.7</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>18.5</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">22.4</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>3.9</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">6.2</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Operating Profit (Loss)</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(16.9)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">16.1</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(0.9)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">3.3</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(3.5)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(3.2)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">**The Americas segment includes the North America, Latin America and Brazil markets, EMEA includes operations in the Europe, Middle East and Africa markets, and JAPIC includes operations in the Asia and Pacific markets, including China.</span> Overall, the Lift Truck business generated an operating loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$21.3 million</span> compared with operating profit of <span class=""xn-money"">$16.2 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020 despite higher revenues. The substantial decline was primarily due to a significant decrease in gross profit and higher operating expenses in the Americas and EMEA segments. Gross profit declined primarily due to cost increases of <span class=""xn-money"">$37.2 million</span> driven by significant material cost and freight inflation, net of price increases of <span class=""xn-money"">$5.5 million</span>, and a shift in sales mix to lower-margin lift trucks. Additionally, component shortages resulting from supply chain and logistics constraints had a severe impact on the Company's ability to produce and ship products out of backlog, resulting in manufacturing costs <span class=""xn-money"">$6.4 million</span> higher than the 2020 third quarter. The realization of higher margins on parts sales and higher unit volumes partly offset these significantly increased material and freight costs. Operating expenses increased mainly as a result of the reinstatement of pre-pandemic salaries and benefits that were suspended in 2020. While all three of the geographic Lift Truck segments were affected by these unfavorable increases in material and freight costs, the Americas segment experienced the greatest impact. Despite a 15.8% increase in revenues resulting from higher unit and parts volumes in the third quarter of 2021 compared with the prior year quarter, the Americas generated an operating loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$16.9 million</span> compared to operating profit of <span class=""xn-money"">$16.1 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020. The Americas loss was largely due to a <span class=""xn-money"">$32.8 million</span> increase in material and freight costs and higher manufacturing costs as a result of inefficiencies associated with component shortages that constrained the Americas' ability to ship product.  In the third quarter of 2021, the EMEA segment experienced production delays and higher costs, but to a lesser extent than in the Americas. Revenues increased 6.7% compared with the 2020 third quarter. EMEA reported an operating loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.9 million</span> compared with an operating profit of <span class=""xn-money"">$3.3 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020. In addition to the component shortages due to supply chain constraints and material and freight cost inflation, the absence of pandemic-related government support incentives of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.5 million</span> received in the prior year and the reinstatement of pre-pandemic salaries and benefits also contributed to the lower EMEA results. Revenues in the JAPIC segment during the third quarter of 2021 increased 16.9% over the third quarter of 2020. JAPIC generated an operating loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$3.5 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021 compared with an operating loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$3.2 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020. Unlike in the Americas and EMEA, lower gross profit due to material and freight cost inflation and additional manufacturing costs were largely offset by lower operating expenses. <b><u>Hyster-Yale Group Strategic Perspective </u></b> The global lift truck market is expected to decline in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with the prior year fourth quarter, but still remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Markets in 2022 are expected to recede from the historical highs of 2021, but still be higher than pre-pandemic levels. As a result of this market outlook, the Lift Truck business is anticipating a substantial decrease in bookings in the 2021 fourth quarter compared with the third quarter of 2021, and in the succeeding 2022 quarters compared with the respective 2021 quarters.  In the first nine months of 2021, the Company has experienced production and shipment levels which are far lower than its objectives due to supply chain logistics constraints. This is anticipated to continue in the 2021 fourth quarter and in at least the first half of 2022. Nonetheless, shipments are expected to increase over the prior year fourth quarter and the third quarter of 2021. Significant material cost inflation and higher freight costs, which continued to worsen in the 2021 third quarter, and the current non-renewal of tariff exclusions are expected to continue to affect the cost of components and freight negatively over the remainder of 2021 compared with the prior year fourth quarter. The Lift Truck business has implemented price increases several times over the course of 2021 to moderate the effect of material cost inflation, but many of the orders in the backlog slotted for production in the remainder of 2021 and the first half of 2022 do not reflect the full effect of all these price increases. As a result, the Company expects to continue to experience low margins in the fourth quarter of 2021 and, at best, in the first half of 2022, due to the lag between when unit price increases went into effect and when they are realized as the units are shipped. The Company will continue to work aggressively to manage supply chain and logistics costs and component availability and tariff exclusions, and will adjust prices accordingly. As a result of these factors, and the increase in costs associated with the reinstatement of pre-pandemic salaries and benefits, significant operating and net losses are expected in the Lift Truck business in the 2021 fourth quarter and in the first half of 2022.  From a strategic perspective, Hyster-Yale Group has three core strategies that are expected to have a transformational impact on the Company's competitiveness, market position and economic performance. The first is to provide the lowest cost of ownership while enhancing customer productivity. The primary focus of this strategic initiative is the new modular and scalable product projects, which are expected to lay the groundwork for enhanced market position by providing lower cost of ownership and enhanced productivity for the Company's customers, including low-intensity applications. Additional to this are key projects geared toward electrification of trucks for applications now dominated by internal combustion engine trucks, automation product options and providing telemetry and operator assist systems. The second core strategy is to be the leader in the delivery of industry- and customer-focused solutions. The primary focus for this strategic initiative is transforming the Company's sales approach by using an industry-focused approach to meet its customers' needs. The third core strategy is to be the leader in independent distribution. The main focus of this strategic initiative is on dealer and major account coverage, dealer excellence and ensuring outstanding dealer ownership globally.  As a result of these core strategies and the increased shipment volume potential of the current backlog and 2022 expected bookings, the Lift Truck business expects to return to an operating profit in the second half of 2022. Over this period, the Company is assuming the stabilization or reduction of product and transportation costs and the continued expectation of improved component and logistics availability. Over this period and the longer term, the Company is also assuming the continued introduction of the currently released and additional modular and scalable product families and the continued implementation of cost savings initiatives. <b><u>Bolzoni Results</u></b> Bolzoni's revenues for the 2021 third quarter increased to <span class=""xn-money"">$90.0 million</span> from <span class=""xn-money"">$63.3 million</span> in the 2020 third quarter primarily as a result of higher sales volumes partly offset by a shift in sales toward lower-priced products. Despite higher revenues, higher material and freight costs and component shortages due to supply chain constraints resulted in Bolzoni reporting breakeven operating results, which are comparable to the 2020 third quarter. <b><u>Bolzoni Strategic Perspective</u></b> Bolzoni expects increases in operating profit and net income in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with both the prior-year period and the first nine months of 2021. Over the course of 2022, Bolzoni expects component shortages to moderate and pricing to permit improved returns as the year progresses despite higher costs. Bolzoni continues to focus on implementing its ""One Company - 3 Brands"" organizational approach to help streamline corporate operations and strengthen its <span class=""xn-location"">North America</span> and JAPIC commercial operations. Bolzoni is working to increase its Americas business by strengthening its ability to serve key attachment industries and customers in the <span class=""xn-location"">North America</span> market through the introduction of a broader range of locally produced attachments with shorter lead times, while continuing to sell cylinders and various other components produced in its <span class=""xn-location"">Sulligent, Alabama</span> plant. Bolzoni is also increasing its sales, marketing and product support capabilities both in <span class=""xn-location"">North America</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span> based on an industry-specific approach, with an immediate focus on the paper, beverage, appliance, 3PL and automotive industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b><u>Nuvera Results</u></b> Nuvera's revenues decreased to <span class=""xn-money"">$0.2 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021 from <span class=""xn-money"">$0.7 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020. The revenue decrease was primarily the result of fewer sales of fuel cell engines for lift truck battery-box replacements. Nuvera continues to focus on increasing its sales pipeline for its 45kW and 60kW engines in all major geographic areas by strengthening its commercial programs. Despite an accelerating demonstration pipeline, the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain constraints have delayed Nuvera's ability to book, manufacture and ship revenue-generating orders for its larger engines. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including border closures and a reduced speed of market development, particularly in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>, significantly reduced progress on certain research, development and sales agreements entered into by Nuvera prior to the pandemic. In anticipation of fulfilling these agreements, Nuvera had made significant investments in manufacturing equipment and inventory to support future production. In the third quarter of 2021, as a result of a reduced near-term sales forecast, Nuvera reduced its inventory value by <span class=""xn-money"">$14.8 million</span> to its estimated net realizable value and recorded a <span class=""xn-money"">$10.0 million</span> fixed asset impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of its fixed assets to market value. As a result of these charges, Nuvera reported a 2021 third quarter operating loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$32.5 million</span> compared with a loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$8.7 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020.  <b><u>Nuvera Strategic Perspective</u></b> Nuvera continues to focus on serving niche, heavy-duty vehicle applications with expected strong near-term fuel cell adoption potential, using its 45kW and 60kW engines, which were both released for sale late in 2020. As a result of these releases, Nuvera accelerated its 45kW and 60kW engine commercialization operations for the global market. In the fourth quarter of 2021 and in 2022, Nuvera will continue to focus on ramping up demonstrations, quotes and bookings of these products. In addition, Nuvera has initiated development of a new 125kW engine and continues to focus on applications in the forklift truck market.  <b><u>Consolidated Outlook </u></b> Given the extensive component shortages due to supply chain constraints, significant material and freight cost inflation, as well as continued losses at Nuvera, the Company, on a consolidated basis, expects significant operating and net losses for the 2021 fourth quarter and in the first half of 2022. Consolidated results are expected to return to an operating profit in the second half of 2022 assuming reasonable resolution of component shortages and relative stabilization of material and freight costs. The Company also expects to have moderately reduced losses at Nuvera as a result of enhanced fuel cell shipments. While the Company expects to make additional investments in the business during the fourth quarter of 2021, and in 2022, maintaining liquidity will continue to be a priority. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2021 are expected to be approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$22 million</span>.  ***** <b><u>Conference Call</u></b> In conjunction with this news release, the management of Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc. will host a conference call on <span class=""xn-chron"">Wednesday, November 3, 2021</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">11:00 a.m. Eastern Time</span>.

 Third Quarter Net Income of $314 Million and Adjusted Operating Income of $239 Million News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:45 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">RICHMOND, Va.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp; Genworth Financial, Inc. (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genworth-financial-announces-third-quarter-2021-results-301414457.html#financial-modal"">GNW</a>) today reported results for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2021. The company reported net income<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;of <span class=""xn-money"">$314 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.61</span> per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2021, compared with net income of $418&nbsp;million, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.82</span> per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2020. The company reported adjusted operating income<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of $239&nbsp;million, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.46</span> per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2021, compared with adjusted operating income of $125&nbsp;million, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.25</span> per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2020. ""Genworth delivered another quarter of strong results,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Tom McInerney</span>, Genworth President and CEO. ""At the same time, we continued to execute against our strategic plan, including the successful completion of the Enact IPO which improved Genworth's financial position and drove ratings improvements at both Enact and Genworth. With this critical step behind us, we have a clearer path to reduce holding company debt to a more sustainable level, which in turn will enable Genworth to pursue other strategic priorities that are aimed at creating both near-term and long-term shareholder value."" <b><b><u>Strategic Highlights</u></b></b> <b><b><u>Financial Performance</u></b></b> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Consolidated Net Income &amp; Adjusted Operating Income</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Three months ended September 30</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">2021</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">2020</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Per</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Per</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">diluted</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">diluted</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Total</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>(Amounts in millions, except per share)</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Total</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">share</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Total</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">share</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">% change</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Net income available to Genworth's common stockholders</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">314</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">0.61</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">418</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">0.82</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(25)%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Adjusted operating income</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">239</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">0.46</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">125</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">0.25</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">91 %</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Weighted-average diluted shares</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">514.2</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">511.5</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">As of September 30</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">2021</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">2020</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Book value per share</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">30.11</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">29.19</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">income (loss)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">22.62</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">20.99</span> On <span class=""xn-chron"">September 16, 2021</span>, the company completed the minority IPO of 18.4 percent of its U.S. mortgage insurance business, Enact, and as a result, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Enact segment was <span class=""xn-money"">$4 million</span> in the current quarter. The company's net income, before noncontrolling interests in the Enact segment, was <span class=""xn-money"">$318 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021. The company's adjusted operating income, before noncontrolling interests in the Enact segment, for the third quarter of 2021 was <span class=""xn-money"">$243 million</span>. Net investment gains, net of taxes and other adjustments, increased net income by <span class=""xn-money"">$70 million</span> in the current quarter. The investment gains were primarily driven by mark-to-market gains on limited partnership investments held in the LTC business. Net income in the third quarter of 2020 included <span class=""xn-money"">$277 million</span> of investment gains, net of taxes and other adjustments. Net investment income was <span class=""xn-money"">$859 million</span> in the quarter, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$844 million</span> in the prior quarter and <span class=""xn-money"">$820 million</span> in the prior year. Net investment income was higher than the prior quarter and prior year as a result of higher variable investment income, including income from limited partnerships, bond calls, commercial mortgage loan prepayments and the inflation impact on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), primarily in the LTC business. The reported yield and the core yield<sup>3</sup> for the quarter were 5.19 percent and 4.95 percent, respectively, compared to 5.11 percent and 4.85 percent, respectively, in the prior quarter. Genworth's effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the current quarter was approximately 18 percent. The effective tax rate was favorably impacted by higher tax benefits from a reduction in uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations, partially offset by the tax effect of forward starting swap gains settled prior to the change in the corporate tax rate under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which continue to be tax effected at 35 percent as they are amortized into net investment income.

Enact's primary insurance in force increased 10 percent versus the prior year from strong new insurance written (NIW), partially offset by low persistency. Primary NIW decreased 10 percent from the prior quarter and was also down 10 percent versus the prior year primarily from a smaller private mortgage insurance market. Earned premiums in the current quarter were flat compared to the prior quarter and lower than the prior year as insurance in force growth was offset by a decrease in single premium policy cancellations, the continued lapse of older, higher priced policies and higher ceded premiums. In addition, interest expense was higher in the current quarter versus the prior year from a full quarter's interest expense on the <span class=""xn-chron"">August 2020</span> debt issuance. Enact's current quarter results reflected losses of <span class=""xn-money"">$34 million</span> and a loss ratio of 14 percent. Results in the prior quarter and prior year reflected losses of <span class=""xn-money"">$30 million</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$45 million</span>, and a loss ratio of 12 percent and 18 percent, respectively. New delinquencies in the current quarter were 7,427, an increase of eight percent from 6,862 in the prior quarter driven by a seasonal increase. Current quarter new delinquencies decreased 55 percent from 16,664 in the prior year. Losses in the prior year were favorably impacted by incurred but not reported (IBNR) development of <span class=""xn-money"">$23 million</span> that did not recur. Despite the sequential increase in new delinquencies, the current quarter new delinquency rate of 0.8 percent remained consistent with pre-pandemic levels. Approximately 36 percent of new primary delinquencies in the current quarter were reported in forbearance plans which may cure at elevated rates.&nbsp; <b><u>U.S. Life Insurance</u></b> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Adjusted Operating Income (Loss)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>(Amounts in millions)</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Q3 21</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Q2 21</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Q3 20</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Long Term Care Insurance</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">133</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">98</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">59</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Life Insurance</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(68)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(40)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(69)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Fixed Annuities</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">28</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">13</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">24</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Total U.S. Life Insurance</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">93</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">71</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">14</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Long Term Care Insurance In Force Rate Action Performance</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>(Amounts in millions)</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Q3 21</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Q2 21</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Q3 20</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Adjusted Operating Income from In Force Rate Actions<sup>4</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>5</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">304</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">310</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">238</span> <b><i>Long Term Care Insurance</i></b> Long term care insurance reported adjusted operating income of $133&nbsp;million, compared with $98&nbsp;million in the prior quarter and $59&nbsp;million in the prior year. Earnings from in force rate actions were more favorable than the prior year, driven primarily by higher benefit reductions, which included policyholder benefit reduction elections made as part of a legal settlement, net of litigation expenses and taxes.&nbsp;LTC results also reflected higher net investment income of <span class=""xn-money"">$45 million</span> after-tax versus the prior year and <span class=""xn-money"">$7 million</span> after-tax versus the prior quarter from limited partnerships, bond calls, commercial mortgage loan prepayments and gains on TIPS. Claim and active policy terminations in the current quarter were higher compared to the prior quarter but lower compared to the prior year. Higher claim terminations in recent quarters were assumed to be driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and temporary in nature resulting in the establishment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, of a temporary COVID-19 mortality adjustment assuming that the company's mortality experience on the most vulnerable claimants was accelerated, leaving its overall claim population less likely to terminate compared to the pre-pandemic average population. In the current quarter, the company made minimal adjustments to this reserve, leaving a pre-tax balance of <span class=""xn-money"">$142 million</span> as of <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, short-term mortality experience may fluctuate, and the company would increase or decrease the COVID-19 mortality adjustment accordingly. New claim incidence increased versus the prior quarter but has remained lower than pre-pandemic levels. With the historically low new claim incidence, favorable development on IBNR claim reserves has continued, but to a lesser extent. Since the second quarter of 2020, IBNR has been strengthened to reflect the company's assumption that incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic has been temporarily delayed. In the current quarter, given the increase in incidence, IBNR was reduced by <span class=""xn-money"">$17 million</span> after-tax, compared to a strengthening of <span class=""xn-money"">$19 million</span> after-tax in the prior year. <b><i>Life Insurance</i></b> Life insurance reported an adjusted operating loss of $68&nbsp;million, compared with adjusted operating losses of <span class=""xn-money"">$40 million</span> in the prior quarter and $69&nbsp;million in the prior year. Mortality, attributable in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, was higher compared to both the prior quarter and the prior year. Current quarter results also included a <span class=""xn-money"">$30 million</span> after-tax charge related to recoverability testing for deferred acquisition costs (DAC) in the company's universal life insurance products versus a <span class=""xn-money"">$13 million</span> after-tax charge related to these products in the prior quarter.&nbsp;Results in the prior year reflected higher DAC&nbsp;amortization compared to the current year, as the large 20-year level-premium term life insurance block written at the end of 2000 entered its post-level premium period, as well as higher reserve increases during the premium grace period in the 10-year term universal life insurance block associated with policies entering the post-level premium period.  <b><i>Fixed Annuities</i></b> Fixed annuities reported adjusted operating income of $28&nbsp;million, compared with $13&nbsp;million in the prior quarter and $24&nbsp;million in the prior year. Results in the current quarter reflected a reduction in fixed indexed annuity reserves from higher interest rates. Mortality in the single premium immediate annuity product was favorable versus the prior quarter but unfavorable versus the prior year. <b><u>Runoff</u></b> Runoff reported adjusted operating income of $11&nbsp;million, compared with $15&nbsp;million in the prior quarter and $19&nbsp;million in the prior year. Current quarter results in the variable annuity products were unfavorable compared to both the prior quarter and the prior year from equity market performance.&nbsp;Mortality experience in the corporate-owned life insurance business was also higher in the current quarter. <b><u>Corporate And Other</u></b> Corporate and Other reported adjusted operating income of $1&nbsp;million, compared to adjusted operating losses of $27&nbsp;million in the prior quarter and $49&nbsp;million in the prior year. Results in the current quarter included tax benefits of <span class=""xn-money"">$21 million</span> from a reduction in uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations. Interest expense was also lower in the current quarter from the reduction of holding company debt. <b><u>Capital &amp; Liquidity</u></b> Genworth maintains the following capital positions in its operating subsidiaries:  <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Key Capital &amp; Liquidity Metrics</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>(Dollar amounts in millions)</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Q3 21</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Q2 21</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Q3 20</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Enact</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Consolidated Risk-To-Capital Ratio<sup>6</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">11.8:1</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">11.8:1</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">12.1:1</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation Risk-To-Capital Ratio<sup>6</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">11.9:1</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">12.0:1</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">12.3:1</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (PMIERs) Sufficiency Ratio<sup>6,</sup><sup>7</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">181</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">165</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">132</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">U.S. Life Insurance Companies</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Consolidated Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Ratio<sup>6</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">290</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">272</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">239</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Holding Company Cash and Liquid Assets<sup>8</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>9</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">638</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">842</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">814</span> <b>Key Points</b> <b><b>About Genworth Financial&nbsp;</b></b> Genworth Financial, Inc.

Adjusted operating income (loss) per share is derived from adjusted operating income (loss). The chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance and allocates resources on the basis of adjusted operating income (loss). The company defines adjusted operating income (loss) as income (loss) from continuing operations excluding the after-tax effects of income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests, net investment gains (losses), gains (losses) on the sale of businesses, gains (losses) on the early extinguishment of debt, gains (losses) on insurance block transactions, restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non-operating items. Gains (losses) on insurance block transactions are defined as gains (losses) on the early extinguishment of non-recourse funding obligations, early termination fees for other financing restructuring and/or resulting gains (losses) on reinsurance restructuring for certain blocks of business. The company excludes net investment gains (losses) and infrequent or unusual non-operating items because the company does not consider them to be related to the operating performance of the company's segments and Corporate and Other activities. A component of the company's net investment gains (losses) is the result of estimated future credit losses, the size and timing of which can vary significantly depending on market credit cycles. In addition, the size and timing of other investment gains (losses) can be subject to the company's discretion and are influenced by market opportunities, as well as asset-liability matching considerations. Gains (losses) on the sale of businesses, gains (losses) on the early extinguishment of debt, gains (losses) on insurance block transactions and restructuring costs are also excluded from adjusted operating income (loss) because, in the company's opinion, they are not indicative of overall operating trends. Infrequent or unusual non-operating items are also excluded from adjusted operating income (loss) if, in the company's opinion, they are not indicative of overall operating trends.  While some of these items may be significant components of net income (loss) available to Genworth Financial, Inc.'s common stockholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the company believes that adjusted operating income (loss) and measures that are derived from or incorporate adjusted operating income (loss), including adjusted operating income (loss) per share on a basic and diluted basis, are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income (loss) attributable to the ongoing operations of the business. Management also uses adjusted operating income (loss) as a basis for determining awards and compensation for senior management and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by analysts. However, the items excluded from adjusted operating income (loss) have occurred in the past and could, and in some cases will, recur in the future. Adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share on a basic and diluted basis are not substitutes for net income (loss) available to Genworth Financial, Inc.'s common stockholders or net income (loss) available to Genworth Financial, Inc.'s common stockholders per share on a basic and diluted basis determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the company's definition of adjusted operating income (loss) may differ from the definitions used by other companies.  Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) available to Genworth Financial, Inc.'s common stockholders to adjusted operating income (loss) assume a 21 percent tax rate and are net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests. Net investment gains (losses) are also adjusted for DAC and other intangible amortization and certain benefit reserves.  In the third quarter of 2021, the company paid a pre-tax make-whole premium of <span class=""xn-money"">$6 million</span> related to the early redemption of Genworth Holdings, Inc.'s senior notes originally scheduled to mature in <span class=""xn-chron"">September 2021</span>. This transaction was excluded from adjusted operating income (loss) as it relates to gains (losses) on the early extinguishment of debt. The company recorded a pre-tax expense of <span class=""xn-money"">$3 million</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$5 million</span> in the third and second quarters of 2021, respectively, related to restructuring costs as it continues to evaluate and appropriately size its organizational needs and expenses. There were no infrequent or unusual items excluded from adjusted operating income (loss) during the periods presented. The tables at the end of this press release provide a reconciliation of net income available to Genworth Financial, Inc.'s common stockholders to adjusted operating income for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> and 2020, as well as for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">June 30, 2021</span>, and reflect adjusted operating income (loss) as determined in accordance with accounting guidance related to segment reporting.  This press release includes the non-GAAP financial measure entitled ""core yield"" as a measure of investment yield. The company defines core yield as the investment yield adjusted for items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the investment portfolio. Management believes that analysis of core yield enhances understanding of the investment yield of the company. However, core yield is not a substitute for investment yield determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the company's definition of core yield may differ from the definitions used by other companies. A reconciliation of reported U.S. GAAP yield to core yield is included in a table at the end of this press release. <b>Definition of Selected Operating Performance Measures</b> The company taxes its businesses at the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate of 21 percent. Each segment is then adjusted to reflect the unique tax attributes of that segment such as permanent differences between U.S. GAAP and tax law. The difference between the consolidated provision for income taxes and the sum of the provision for income taxes in each segment is reflected in Corporate and Other activities.  The annually-determined tax rates and adjustments to each segment's provision for income taxes are estimates which are subject to review and could change from year to year.  The company reports selected operating performance measures including ""sales"" and ""insurance in force"" or ""risk in force"" which are commonly used in the insurance industry as measures of operating performance.  Management regularly monitors and reports sales metrics as a measure of volume of new business generated in a period. Sales refer to new insurance written for mortgage insurance products included in the company's Enact segment. The company considers new insurance written to be a measure of the company's operating performance because it represents a measure of new sales of insurance policies during a specified period, rather than a measure of the company's revenues or profitability during that period.  Management regularly monitors and reports insurance in force and risk in force for the company's Enact segment. Insurance in force is a measure of the aggregate unpaid principal balance as of the respective reporting date for loans the company insures. Risk in force is based on the coverage percentage applied to the estimated current outstanding loan balance. The company considers insurance in force and risk in force to be measures of its operating performance because they represent measures of the size of its business at a specific date which will generate revenues and profits in a future period, rather than measures of its revenues or profitability during that period.  Management also regularly monitors and reports a loss ratio for the company's businesses. For the company's Enact segment, the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in policy reserves to net earned premiums. For the long term care insurance business included in the company's U.S. Life Insurance segment, the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in reserves less tabular interest on reserves less loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The company considers the loss ratio to be a measure of underwriting performance in these businesses and helps to enhance the understanding of the operating performance of the businesses.  Management also regularly monitors and reports adjusted operating income from in force rate actions in the long term care insurance business included in the company's U.S. Life Insurance segment. Adjusted operating income from in force rate actions includes premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on its long term care insurance products implemented since 2012, which are net of estimated premium tax, commissions, and other expenses on an after-tax basis. Estimates for in force rate actions reflect certain simplifying assumptions that may vary materially from actual historical results, including but not limited to a uniform rate of coinsurance and premium taxes in addition to consistent policyholder behavior over time. Actual behavior may differ significantly from these assumptions. In addition, estimates exclude reserve updates resulting from profits followed by losses. The company considers adjusted operating income from in force rate actions to be a measure of its operating performance because it helps bring older generation long term care insurance blocks closer to a break-even point over time and helps bring the loss ratios on newer long term care insurance blocks back towards their original pricing. These operating performance measures enable the company to compare its operating performance across periods without regard to revenues or profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources. <b>Cautionary&nbsp;Note&nbsp;Regarding&nbsp;Forward-Looking Statements</b> This press release contains certain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

""This quarter our insurance operations saw the benefit of recent changes in our property catastrophe underwriting strategy as we delivered a combined ratio in the low 90s, despite significant natural catastrophe events. Our premium growth accelerated in the third quarter as we continued to attract new business and achieved double-digit rate growth, particularly on our preferred product lines."" ""Our Markel Ventures businesses continue to grow and add value. We added Buckner HeavyLift Cranes to our group in the third quarter, which further strengthens and diversifies our family of companies,"" Gayner and Whitt continued. ""Our investment portfolio delivered solid results for the first nine months, and we continue to evaluate our investment performance with a long-term focus in mind."" ""As we enter the final quarter of 2021, we believe we are well-positioned to finish the year strong, and we will look to all three operating engines to power us through the finish line,"" said Gayner and Whitt. We believe our financial performance is most meaningfully measured over longer periods of time, which tends to mitigate the effects of short-term volatility and also aligns with the longer-term perspective we apply to operating our businesses. We generally use five-year periods to measure our performance. Over the five-year period ended September&nbsp;30, 2021, the compound annual growth in book value per common share outstanding was 10%. Over the five-year period ended September&nbsp;30, 2021, our share price increased at a compound annual rate of 5%.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:38 ET Share this article <b>-EDM Council publica una investigación de la industria sobre las mejores prácticas de información empresarial en materia ESG</b> <span class=""xn-location"">NUEVA YORK</span>, 2 de noviembre de 2021 /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;EDM Council, una asociación comercial intersectorial para la gestión y el análisis de datos, ha publicado su primer informe de investigación en el que se ofrecen ideas y recomendaciones de primera mano para la aplicación de las mejores prácticas relacionadas con la gestión de datos medioambientales, sociales y de gobernanza (ESG) para las entidades que presentan informes corporativos. El informe examina detenidamente: La presentación de informes ESG se encuentra todavía en una fase inicial, a medida que las normas y los reglamentos se desarrollan y evolucionan. Los informes ESG proporcionan información importante sobre el rendimiento, los riesgos y la estrategia general de una empresa, y los datos resultantes son utilizados por múltiples partes interesadas de todo el ecosistema ESG, incluidos inversores, propietarios de activos, reguladores, clientes, proveedores y empleados. El enfoque en ESG, incluyendo las emisiones de carbono, la biodiversidad, el consumo de agua, la salud y la seguridad de los empleados, la diversidad de género, la igualdad salarial, el trabajo infantil, y la cultura y la ética, crea un conjunto único de desafíos debido a las complejidades asociadas con los datos subyacentes, y la gestión de estos datos. Este documento ha sido elaborado por el <span class=""xn-person"">Grupo de Trabajo</span> sobre ESG de EDM Council, que se formó en 2020 para investigar los retos actuales en materia de datos en todo el ecosistema de ESG. El grupo de trabajo abordó el ejercicio observando el problema a través de la lente de un profesional de datos en cada grupo constituyente: entidad de información corporativa, agregador de datos/empresa de investigación/calificación, empresa de inversión/creación de productos y propietario de activos. ""Todo el mundo está tratando de entender cómo incorporar los principios ESG en las estrategias de sus organizaciones y utilizar los datos ESG en todo el ecosistema ESG. Los datos son el pegamento que lo conecta todo. Como resultado, los datos ESG y la gestión de datos son fundamentales para todos los componentes y todavía está en las primeras etapas de desarrollo"", dijo <span class=""xn-person"">Eric Bigelsen</span>, responsable de la participación de la industria y jefe del grupo de trabajo ESG de EDM Council. ""Este documento examina consideraciones tales como la preparación de informes de datos, dónde se encuentra la responsabilidad de los datos, y consejos específicos de nuestro Grupo de Trabajo ESG sobre los pasos clave para mejorar las mejores prácticas ESG dentro de cualquier organización."" Este documento de EDM Council sobre las entidades de información corporativa ESG es la primera parte de una serie de documentos que contendrán los resultados de un estudio de nueve meses de duración en el que se detallan los retos y las recomendaciones en materia de datos ESG. El informe incorpora las aportaciones de los profesionales de los datos de múltiples sectores, de los profesionales de la elaboración de informes de sostenibilidad corporativa, de los expertos en materia de ESG y de otros líderes empresariales en un esfuerzo que abarca más de 80 organizaciones participantes y más de 150 profesionales.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:31 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">NEW YORK</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;In response to the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) filing to block the acquisition of Simon &amp; Schuster (S&amp;S) by Penguin Random House (PRH), both publishing houses issued this joint statement:  ""This is a pro-consumer, pro-author, and pro-book seller transaction, which will allow increased investment in the publishing programs of both S&amp;S and PRH. The transaction will bring PRH's superior order fulfillment services to S&amp;S's titles, benefiting consumers by making it easier to discover new titles and less likely that books will be out of stock, particularly at local retailers. Beyond the benefits to consumers, PRH's reach into independent bookstores and specialty markets will boost the sales of S&amp;S titles, benefiting both authors and retailers. The publishing industry is, and following this transaction will remain, a vibrant and highly competitive environment. PRH and S&amp;S compete with many other publishers including large trade publishers, newer entrants like Amazon, and a range of mid-size and smaller publishers all capable of competing for future titles from established and emerging authors. Blocking the transaction would harm the very authors DOJ purports to protect. We will fight this lawsuit vigorously and look forward to PRH serving as the steward for this storied publishing house in the years to come."" <span class=""xn-person"">Markus Dohle</span>, CEO of Penguin Random House, said: ""Since ViacomCBS announced that it was contemplating selling S&amp;S, we at Penguin Random House knew S&amp;S would have its best home with us—a place that would be committed to carrying forward its storied legacy. We continue to firmly believe this. Our goal is for the new combined company to be truly greater than the sum of its parts, and our focus is to grow our community of distinct imprints that will operate independently and autonomously and will continue to compete vigorously among themselves and with outside competitors, a process that best serves the objective that every author finds the right editor and the best imprint for their work to develop and flourish."" ""DOJ's lawsuit is wrong on the facts, the law, and public policy,"" <span class=""xn-person"">Daniel Petrocelli</span>, Vice Chair of O'Melveny &amp; Meyers and PRH's lead trial attorney, said. ""Importantly, DOJ has not found, nor does it allege, that the combination will reduce competition in the sale of books. The publishing industry is strong and vibrant and has seen strong growth at all levels. We are confident that the robust and competitive landscape that exists will ensure a decision that the acquisition will promote, not harm, competition."" The following are a few of many points that undermine DOJ's claims: <b>Media Contact</b>:<br class=""dnr""><span class=""xn-person"">Claire von Schilling</span><br class=""dnr""><u><a href=""mailto:cvonschilling@penguinrandomhouse.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cvonschilling@penguinrandomhouse.com</a></u><br class=""dnr"">(646) 621-0833 SOURCE Penguin Random House <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>

 Strong revenue growth in Heavy Duty Equipment (""HDE""), Commercial and Industrial Solutions (""CIS"") and Building HVAC (""BHVAC""); earnings negatively impacted by lower Automotive revenue and higher raw material prices News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:30 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">RACINE, Wis.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/modine-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2022-results-301414626.html#financial-modal"">MOD</a>), a diversified global leader in thermal management technology and solutions, today reported financial results for the quarter ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>.  <b>Second Quarter Highlights:</b> ""Our top-line growth in the fiscal second quarter reflects double digit gains in our BHVAC, CIS and HDE segments, which together were up <span class=""xn-money"">$65 million</span>, or 18 percent,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Modine President</span> and Chief Executive Officer, <span class=""xn-person"">Neil D. Brinker</span>.&nbsp;""This growth was partially offset by a <span class=""xn-money"">$45 million</span> decrease in sales in our automotive segment, of which approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$18 million</span> related to the sale of the air-cooled automotive business earlier this fiscal year along with the negative impacts the semiconductor shortage and other supply chain issues. Our operating margins continue to be negatively pressured by rising raw material prices and supply chain disruptions.&nbsp;These significant cost increases, along with the absence of over <span class=""xn-money"">$10 million</span> of COVID-related savings in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, make year-over-year comparisons exceedingly difficult. In response, we are raising prices wherever possible to mitigate these headwinds and to improve operating margins. Our new leadership team is now firmly in place to take these commercial actions and to launch a restructuring program in our Automotive segment. These efforts, and further benefits from deploying 80/20 principles through our business, will quickly enable our transformation and lead to a stronger Modine."" <b>Financial Results</b> Net sales increased 4 percent in the second quarter to <span class=""xn-money"">$478.9 million</span>, compared with <span class=""xn-money"">$461.4 million</span> in the prior year. The increase was driven by market-related volume improvements in the BHVAC, CIS and HDE segments, but was partially offset by a <span class=""xn-money"">$44.5 million</span> decline in the automotive segment, which was impacted by the sale of the air-cooled business in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and the semiconductor shortage.&nbsp;  Gross profit decreased 18 percent in the second quarter to <span class=""xn-money"">$66.3 million</span> and gross margin decreased by 370 basis points to 13.8 percent, primarily driven by higher material prices, including underlying metal prices and related premiums, fabrication, freight, tariff and packaging costs, compared to the prior year. The prior year also benefited from the impact of cost-saving actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors were partially offset by lower depreciation expense in the Automotive segment.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling, general and administrative (""SG&amp;A"") expenses were <span class=""xn-money"">$51.9 million</span> in the second quarter, which was <span class=""xn-money"">$1.1 million</span> higher than the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher compensation-related expenses in the current year, as expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 were impacted by COVID-related cost-saving actions including furloughs, shortened work weeks and temporary salary reductions. This increase was partially offset by lower expenses at Corporate related to severance costs for executive management positions, as the prior year included expenses related to the CEO departure. &nbsp; Operating income in the second quarter was <span class=""xn-money"">$10.5 million</span>, compared to operating income of <span class=""xn-money"">$28.5 million</span> in the prior year. This decrease was driven primarily by lower gross profit in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, as compared to the prior year. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a total of <span class=""xn-money"">$5.9 million</span> of impairment charges, restructuring expenses, strategic reorganization costs, automotive exit strategy costs and environmental expenses. Excluding these items, as well as depreciation and amortization expense, adjusted EBITDA of <span class=""xn-money"">$29.5 million</span> decreased <span class=""xn-money"">$25.9 million</span>, or 47 percent, compared with <span class=""xn-money"">$55.4 million</span> in the prior year.&nbsp; Earnings per share was <span class=""xn-money"">$0.01</span> in the second quarter, compared with earnings per share of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.17</span> in the second quarter last year.&nbsp; Adjusted earnings per share was <span class=""xn-money"">$0.15</span> in the second quarter, compared with adjusted earnings per share of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.43</span> in the second quarter last year. These decreases were primarily due to lower operating earnings compared to the prior year.&nbsp;  <b>Second Quarter Segment Review</b> <b>Balance Sheet &amp; Liquidity</b> Net cash used for operating activities for the six months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> was <span class=""xn-money"">$19.0 million</span>, a decrease of <span class=""xn-money"">$106.3 million</span> compared with net cash provided by operating activities in the same period in the prior year. Free cash flow for the six months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> was a use of <span class=""xn-money"">$39.4 million</span>, down <span class=""xn-money"">$112.1 million</span> from the prior year, primarily resulting from unfavorable net changes in working capital and higher capital expenditures as compared to the prior year. &nbsp;Higher inventory balances resulted from increased raw material prices and strategic safety stock builds in connection with supply chain challenges. In addition, free cash flow was unusually strong in the first six months of fiscal 2021 due to the deferral of certain cash payments in an effort to conserve cash in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including incentive compensation and the purchase of certain program-related equipment and tooling. Cash payments for restructuring activities, automotive strategy and separation costs, and strategic reorganization costs during the first six months of fiscal 2022 totaled <span class=""xn-money"">$7.7 million</span>.&nbsp;  Total debt was <span class=""xn-money"">$388.9 million</span> as of <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter were <span class=""xn-money"">$56.0 million</span>. Net debt was <span class=""xn-money"">$332.9 million</span> as of <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, an increase of <span class=""xn-money"">$36.2 million</span> from the end of fiscal 2021.&nbsp;  <b>Outlook </b> ""Material costs have increased further over the past several months and it will take us longer to fully offset these increases with commercial actions and contractual metals pass through pricing adjustments,"" said Brinker.&nbsp; ""In addition, we have reduced our revenue outlook for the Automotive business given the ongoing impact of the semiconductor shortage and other supply chain disruptions on production volumes. Although our BHVAC, CIS and HDE segments continue to have strong order intake, we are lowering our full-year guidance due to the weaker outlook for our Automotive segment and due to ongoing material cost inflation and supply chain issues.""&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on current exchange rates and market outlook, Modine provides the following guidance ranges for fiscal 2022: Brinker concluded, ""We are working to mitigate the impact of supply chain and inflationary pressures in order to improve operating margins and cash flows, while also continuing to build momentum around the longer-term repositioning and transformation of our business. There are numerous disruptive technologies across our markets that require new and creative ways to manage heat transfer where we can build upon areas where we are already positioned to provide a complete systems solution. We have the right leadership team in place to drive this transformation and become a stronger Modine, and are developing the strategies to promote long-term growth and drive shareholder value.""&nbsp;  <b>Conference Call and Webcast </b> Modine will conduct a conference call and live webcast, with a slide presentation, on <span class=""xn-chron"">Wednesday, November 3, 2021</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">8:00 a.m. Central Time</span> (<span class=""xn-chron"">9:00 a.m. Eastern Time</span>) to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2022 financial results.

Management compensates for this by using these measures in combination with the GAAP measures. However, these measures are not, and should not be viewed, as substitutes for the applicable GAAP measures, and may be different from similarly-titled measures used by other companies.&nbsp;  <b>Definition – Adjusted EBITDA </b> Net earnings excluding interest expense, the provision or benefit for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses, other income and expense, restructuring expenses, impairment charges, costs associated with the review of strategic alternatives for the Automotive segment's business operations, strategic reorganization costs, and certain other gains or charges.&nbsp; The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA provides a relevant measure of profitability and earnings power.&nbsp; The Company views this financial metric as being useful to assess operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that it believes are not representative of its core business.&nbsp; Adjusted EBITDA, when calculated for the business segments, is defined as GAAP operating income excluding depreciation and amortization expenses, restructuring expenses, impairment charges, and certain other gains or charges. <b>Definition – Adjusted earnings per share</b> Diluted earnings per share plus restructuring expenses, impairment charges, costs associated with the review of strategic alternatives for the Automotive segment's business operations, strategic reorganization costs,&nbsp;and excluding changes in income tax valuation allowances and certain other gains or charges. &nbsp;Adjusted earnings per share is an overall performance measure, not including non-cash impairment charges, costs associated with restructuring activities and certain other gains or charges.&nbsp;  <b>Definition – Net debt</b> The sum of debt due within one year and long-term debt, less cash and cash equivalents. This is an indicator of the Company's debt position after considering on-hand cash balances. <b>Definition – Free cash flow </b> Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for property, plant and equipment.&nbsp; This measure presents cash generated from operations during the period that is available for strategic capital decisions. <b>Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure</b> The Company's fiscal 2022 guidance includes adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.&nbsp; The full-year fiscal 2022 guidance for adjusted EBITDA is based upon the Company's estimates for interest expense of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$15</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$16 million</span>, a provision for income taxes of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$16</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$20 million</span>, and depreciation and amortization expense of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$50</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$55 million</span>.&nbsp; Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain cash and non-cash expenses or gains. These expenses and gains may be significant and include items such as restructuring expenses (including severance costs and plant consolidation and relocation expenses), costs associated with the review of strategic alternatives for the automotive business, strategic reorganization activities, impairment charges and certain other items.&nbsp; These expenses and gains for the first six months of fiscal 2022 are presented on page 9.&nbsp; Estimates of these expenses and gains for the remainder of fiscal 2022 are not available due to the low visibility and unpredictability of these items. <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Modine Manufacturing Company</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Consolidated statements of operations (unaudited)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(In millions, except per share amounts)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Three months ended September 30,</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Six months ended September 30,</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">2020</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">2020</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Net sales</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$ &nbsp;

Revenue increased 9 percent organically. On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.22</span> per diluted share in the third quarter, an increase of 44 percent versus third quarter 2020. Adjusted earnings were <span class=""xn-money"">$1.43</span> per diluted share, an increase of 17 percent versus third quarter 2020, and <span class=""xn-money"">12 cents</span> above the midpoint of guidance. <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Third Quarter Adjusted EPS versus Guidance (midpoint)*</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>+12 cents*</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Adjusted EBITDA</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">+12 cents</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Depreciation and amortization</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">-1 cent</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Share count</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">+1 cent</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">All other factors</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">-</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">* Guidance refers to midpoint of EPS guidance presented on August 3, 2021 </span> <span class=""xn-person"">Mark Douglas</span>, FMC president and chief executive officer, said, ""FMC delivered a strong quarter driven by robust product demand. Our operations and procurement teams overcame supply chain and logistics challenges that have impacted many industries. Adjusted EBITDA momentum not only reflects volume growth, but also our focus on increasing prices, continued cost discipline, and a shift in timing of some cost headwinds. In addition, we are seeing significant contribution to growth this year from new product launches and from FMC's Plant Health business, reflecting the strength of our innovation capabilities and world-class R&amp;D pipeline."" The third quarter revenue growth was driven by 9 percent contribution from volume and a 1 percent FX tailwind. Invoice level prices increased in all regions during the quarter; this was masked by some favorable rebate and other adjustments in the prior-year period that did not repeat. In <span class=""xn-location"">Asia</span>, revenue increased 20 percent (up 19 percent organically) driven by broad-based volume growth and price increases across nearly all countries. EMEA grew revenue 12 percent (up 10 percent organically) driven by strong demand for FMC herbicides and diamides across the whole region. In <span class=""xn-location"">Latin America</span>, revenue increased 11 percent (up 9 percent organically) driven by soybean and corn growth in <span class=""xn-location"">Brazil</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Argentina</span>, as well as price increases. In <span class=""xn-location"">North America</span>, sales decreased 6 percent (down 6 percent organically), reflecting year-over-year impact of a continued shift in volume by geography from the company's global diamide partnerships. Excluding revenue from the global partnerships, the region grew more than 20 percent driven by strong demand for diamides and fall herbicides, as well as price increases. Finally, FMC's Plant Health business had an excellent quarter with 40 percent year-over-year growth led by biologicals. <span class=""prnews_span""><b>FMC Revenue</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Q3 2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Total Revenue Change (GAAP)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>10%</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Less FX Impact</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1%</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Organic Revenue Change (Non-GAAP)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>9%</b></span> <b>2021 Outlook<sup>2</sup></b> The company maintains its forecast for full-year 2021 revenue to be in the range of <span class=""xn-money"">$4.9 billion</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$5.1 billion</span>, representing an 8 percent increase at the midpoint versus 2020. &nbsp;Full-year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.29 billion</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$1.35 billion</span>, representing a 6 percent year-over-year growth at the midpoint. 2021 adjusted earnings is now expected to be in the range of <span class=""xn-money"">$6.59</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$6.99</span> per diluted share, up 10 percent at the midpoint, reflecting the impact of share repurchases completed year-to-date.&nbsp;  Full-year earnings growth can be attributed to strong volume growth of higher margin products, the launch of new products including Xyway<sup>TM</sup> fungicide, Overwatch<sup>®</sup> herbicide and Vantacor<sup>TM</sup> insect control, as well as price increases.

These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from any results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement. Currently, one of the most significant factors is the potential adverse effect of the current COVID-19 pandemic on the financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance of FMC, which is substantially influenced by the potential adverse effect of the pandemic on FMC's customers and suppliers and the global economy and financial markets. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts us will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others.&nbsp; Additional factors include, among other things, the risk factors included within FMC's 2020 Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Moreover, investors are cautioned to interpret many of these factors as being heightened as a result of the ongoing and numerous adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. </i> <i>FMC cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the above cautionary statement.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:30 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">DUBLIN</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- The <a href=""https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5457641/automotive-exhaust-systems-market-size-share-and?utm_source=CI&amp;utm_medium=PressRelease&amp;utm_code=vkmfqr&amp;utm_campaign=1612354+-+Global+Automotive+Exhaust+Systems+Market+(2021+to+2028)+-+Featuring+Bosal%2c+Continental+and+Faurecia+Among+Others&amp;utm_exec=jamu273prd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Automotive Exhaust Systems Market Size, Share &amp; Trends Analysis Report By Component, By Fuel Type (Gasoline, Diesel), By Vehicle Type (Passenger Car, Commercial Vehicles), By Region, and Segment Forecasts, 2021-2028""</a> report has been added to <b>ResearchAndMarkets.com's</b> offering. The global automotive exhaust systems market size is expected to reach <span class=""xn-money"">USD 68.45 billion</span> by 2028. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2021 to 2028. Stringent government regulations associated with vehicle emissions coupled with the increasing penetration of after-treatment devices are anticipated to drive the demand for automotive exhaust systems. Moreover, the increasing sales of passenger cars and commercial vehicles along with the growing demand for lightweight emission systems are expected to create significant opportunities for players operating across the value chain of the market.<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr"">Automotive OEMs are working on several aspects, such as new and lightweight materials, drivetrain (engine/transmission) efficiency, and aerodynamic design, to reduce the vehicular weight. Conventional exhaust systems and their components are manufactured using materials such as stainless steel, cast iron, and mild steel/carbon steel. However, several automotive OEMs, exhaust system manufacturers, and other companies are working to provide lightweight products made from composite metals with high-temperature resistance. For instance, Tenneco Inc. offers lightweight compact systems and lightweight after-treatment and dosing systems to improve the fuel economy and thermal management of the exhaust system and overall vehicle.<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr"">The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic hampered the overall business scenario in 2020, and the economy is expected to continue experiencing its aftermath over the next few years. Supply chains were disrupted and production was suspended temporarily at several production facilities because of the lockdowns and restrictions imposed in various parts of the world. Subsequently, shipments got delayed and production volumes plummeted, thereby affecting the overall automotive production. As a result of the pandemic, several companies and exhaust system manufacturers confronted a year-on-year decline in unit volumes and revenues. For instance, Eberspacher, a prominent market player in the exhaust system market, witnessed a decline in the Exhaust Technology business segment revenue. The company's exhaust technology sales decreased by 0.4% year-over-year to <span class=""xn-money"">USD 6,033.1 million</span> in 2020 compared to <span class=""xn-money"">USD 6,099.46 million</span> in 2019.<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr"">In 2020, <span class=""xn-location"">Asia Pacific</span> captured around 60% of the automotive exhaust systems demand and is estimated to register a CAGR of around 7.0% over the forecast period. This share is attributed to the increasing production and sales of passenger cars and commercial vehicles in emerging economies such as <span class=""xn-location"">India</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">China</span>. <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> has been the largest automotive manufacturer in the world since 2008. The country's automotive production annual volumes are greater than the volumes of the European Union (EU). <span class=""xn-location"">India</span> is the fifth-largest automotive manufacturing country in the world. The Indian market is estimated to expand at the highest CAGR over the forecast period as the Indian government is taking several initiatives to develop the automotive sector in the country. The Automotive Mission Plan 2016-2026 is a joint initiative by the Indian Automotive Manufacturers and the government to plan a roadmap for developing the automotive sector in the country.<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr""><b>Automotive Exhaust Systems Market Report Highlights</b> <b>Key Topics Covered:</b> <br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr""><b>Chapter 1.

 Cloud &amp; Infrastructure Revenue Growth Continues; Total Company Gross Profit and Free Cash Flow Grow Year Over Year; Company Reaffirms FY 2021 Guidance News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:30 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">BLUE BELL, Pa.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp; <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344718-1&amp;h=1433325051&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unisys.com%2F&amp;a=Unisys+Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unisys Corporation</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/unisys-announces-3q21-results-301414623.html#financial-modal"">UIS</a>) today reported third-quarter 2021 financial results. ""During the third quarter, we made continued progress executing on our strategy for sustained revenue growth and margin improvement by expanding the company's solution portfolio and enhancing go-to-market efforts, while proactively managing the workforce to successfully attract and retain talent in a competitive labor market,"" said Unisys Chair and CEO <span class=""xn-person"">Peter A. Altabef</span>. ""We did this while increasing gross profit, free cash flow and total contract value year over year.""  <b><u>Summary of Third-Quarter 2021 Results</u></b> <b><u>Leadership Changes </u></b> The company announced the appointment of Unisys Chief Financial Officer (CFO) <span class=""xn-person"">Mike Thomson</span> as president and chief operating officer (COO), effective upon the hiring of a new CFO. Thomson has driven the financial transformation of the company since becoming CFO in 2019, including the substantial strengthening of the company's balance sheet. Thomson has also played an important operational role in the company, as he currently runs the company's corporate development efforts and oversees the strategy function. The company has begun the search for a new CFO. Thomson will succeed current Unisys President and COO <span class=""xn-person"">Eric Hutto</span>, who is stepping down after 6.5 years of service with the company to pursue other interests. Hutto, who was instrumental in improving the financial performance of the company in recent years and in the implementation of the company's new strategy and operating model, will be leaving his current role on <span class=""xn-chron"">November 30</span>. Chair and CEO <span class=""xn-person"">Peter Altabef</span> will assume Hutto's responsibilities on an interim basis until the CFO transition is complete. <b><u>Financial Highlights by Segment:</u></b> <u>DWS:</u> <u>C&amp;I:</u> <u>ECS:</u> <b>Conference Call</b> Unisys will hold a conference call <span class=""xn-chron"">November 3</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">8:00 a.m. Eastern Time</span> to discuss its results. The listen-only webcast, as well as the accompanying presentation materials, can be accessed on the Unisys Investor website at <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344718-1&amp;h=3005695495&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unisys.com%2Finvestor&amp;a=www.unisys.com%2Finvestor"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.unisys.com/investor</a>. Following the call, an audio replay of the webcast, and accompanying presentation materials, can be accessed through the same link. <sup>(1) </sup><b>Backlog</b> – Represents future revenue associated with contracted work which has not yet been delivered or performed. Although we believe this backlog is firm, we may, for commercial reasons, allow the orders to be cancelled, with or without penalty.&nbsp; <sup>(2) </sup><b>Pipeline</b> – Pipeline represents prospective sale opportunities being pursued or for which bids have been submitted.&nbsp;There is no assurance that pipeline will translate into recorded revenue. <sup>(3)</sup>&nbsp;<b>Total Contract Value</b> – TCV is the estimated total contractual revenue related to contracts signed in the period without regard for cancellation terms. New business TCV represents TCV attributable to new scope for existing clients and new logo contracts. <b>Non-GAAP and Other Information</b> Although appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), the company's results reflect charges that the company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations and that can make its profitability and liquidity results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or to its competitors' results. These items consist of certain portions of post-retirement, debt exchange and extinguishment and cost-reduction and other expenses. Management believes each of these items can distort the visibility of trends associated with the company's ongoing performance. Management also believes that the evaluation of the company's financial performance can be enhanced by use of supplemental presentation of its results that exclude the impact of these items in order to enhance consistency and comparativeness with prior or future period results. The following measures are often provided and utilized by the company's management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results, as well as to compare results to other companies in our industry. <sup>(4)</sup>&nbsp;<b>Non-GAAP operating profit</b> – The company recorded pretax post-retirement expense and pretax charges in connection with cost-reduction activities, debt exchange/extinguishment and other expenses. For the company, non-GAAP operating profit excluded these items. The company believes that this profitability measure is more indicative of the company's operating results and aligns those results to the company's external guidance, which is used by the company's management to allocate resources and may be used by analysts and investors to gauge the company's ongoing performance.  <sup>(5) </sup><b>EBITDA &amp; adjusted EBITDA </b>– Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") is calculated by starting with net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Unisys Corporation common shareholders and adding or subtracting the following items: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes post-retirement, debt exchange/extinguishment, and cost-reduction and other expenses, non-cash share-based expense, and other (income) expense adjustment. In order to provide investors with additional understanding of the company's operating results, these charges are excluded from the adjusted EBITDA calculation.  <sup>(6)</sup><b>&nbsp;Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share</b>&nbsp;– The company has recorded post-retirement expense and charges in connection with debt exchange/extinguishment and cost-reduction activities and other expenses. Management believes that investors may have a better understanding of the company's performance and return to shareholders by excluding these charges from the GAAP diluted earnings/loss per share calculations. The tax amounts presented for these items for the calculation of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share include the current and deferred tax expense and benefits recognized under GAAP for these amounts.&nbsp; <sup>(7)</sup>&nbsp;<b>Free cash flow</b> – The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Management believes this liquidity measure gives investors an additional perspective on cash flow from on-going operating activities in excess of amounts used for reinvestment. <sup>(8)</sup>&nbsp;<b>Adjusted free cash flow</b> – Because inclusion of the company's post-retirement contributions, discontinued operations and cost-reduction charges/reimbursements and other payments in free cash flow may distort the visibility of the company's ability to generate cash flow from its operations without the impact of these non-operational costs, management believes that investors may be interested in adjusted free cash flow, which provides free cash flow before these payments. This liquidity measure was provided to analysts and investors in the form of external guidance and is used by management to measure operating liquidity.&nbsp; <b>About Unisys<br class=""dnr""></b>Unisys is a global IT solutions company that delivers successful outcomes for the most demanding businesses and governments.

 - Use of a Pharmacogenomic to Retarget a Failed Clinical Trial with Liafensine in Depression - Case Study of an Exceptional Responder: Enzastaurin Long Term Efficacy in a Patient with Primary and Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) - DB102-01 ENGAGE Study: A biomarker-guided, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase 3 clinical trial of DB102 in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) - Extended benefits in patients with recurrent high grade glioma that continuously receive Toca FC after Toca 511 Treatment - A novel precision medicine approach to advance Toca 511 gene therapy News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:30 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Denovo Biopharma LLC (Denovo), a pioneer in using biomarker-guided precision medicine to develop innovative therapies, today announced presentations at several conferences: one on DB104 (liafensine) at the CNS Summit (November&nbsp;7–10, 2021, <span class=""xn-location"">Boston, MA</span>, USA), two on DB102 (enzastaurin) and one on DB107 (Toca&nbsp;511/Toca&nbsp;FC) at the Society for NeuroOncology (SNO) Annual Meeting (November&nbsp;18–21, 2021, <span class=""xn-location"">Boston, MA</span>, USA), and one on DB107 at the International Oncolytic Virus Conference (IOVC) (November&nbsp;5–7, 2021, <span class=""xn-location"">Sedona, AZ</span>, USA). Podium presentation titled ""Use of a Pharmacogenomic Biomarker to Retarget a Failed Clinical Trial with Liafensine in Depression"" at the CNS Summit describes how Denovo identified the DGM4 pharmacogenomic biomarker that is predictive of efficacy of DB104 in patients with treatment-resistant depression, and also shows that DGM4 did not predict efficacy in patients receiving standard of care treatments and as such was specific to liafensine. Poster # CTNI-25 titled ""Case Study of an Exceptional Responder: Enzastaurin Long Term Efficacy in a Patient with Primary and Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)"" at SNO is a case study of a patient with primary and recurrent GBM who is an exceptional (15-year) responder to DB102. This patient was found to have DGM1, the pharmacogenomic biomarker discovered by Denovo that is associated with an increased survival in patients with GBM who are treated with DB102. Poster # CTNI-08 titled ""DB102-01 ENGAGE Study: A biomarker-guided, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase 3 clinical trial of DB102 in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)"" at SNO describes the Denovo-sponsored ENGAGE clinical trial in patients with newly-diagnosed GBM who are DGM1-positive, and who will receive DB102 in combination with standard of care treatment. Invited podium presentation titled ""A novel precision medicine approach to advance Toca&nbsp;511 gene therapy"" at IOVC covers the results of the Phase&nbsp;3 Toca5 clinical trial, and how a pharmacogenomic approach may guide future treatments of GBM with DB107. Poster #CTNI-03 titled ""Extended benefits in patients with recurrent high grade glioma that continuously receive Toca FC after Toca 511 Treatment"" at SNO covers seven patients with recurrent high grade glioma who have an extended benefit (ranging from 29 months to 7 years and 5 months) upon treatment with DB107 with six still remaining in treatment having either complete responses or stable disease. <b>About DB102 <br class=""dnr""></b>DB102 (enzastaurin) is an orally available first-in-class investigational small molecule, as a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor of the PKC beta, PI3K, and AKT pathways, that has been studied in over 3,000 patients with a range of solid and hematological tumor types. Enzastaurin was originally developed by Eli Lilly, and for which Denovo has acquired worldwide rights. Denovo discovered the novel pharmacogenomic biomarker DGM1<sup>TM</sup> and is conducting a Phase&nbsp;3 trial in patients with newly-diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and another Phase&nbsp;3 trial in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Enzastaurin received Fast Track Designation for GBM from the FDA, Orphan Drug Designation for DLBCL and GBM from the FDA, and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation for DLBCL and GBM from the EMA. <b>About DB104 <br class=""dnr""></b>DB104 (liafensine) is an orally available first-in-class investigational small molecule, as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine triple reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI), that has been studied in over 2,000 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Liafensine was originally developed by Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (AMRI) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), and for which Denovo has acquired worldwide rights. Denovo discovered the novel pharmacogenomic biomarker DGM4<sup>TM</sup> and is planning a Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial. <b>About DB107 <br class=""dnr""></b>DB107 (Toca&nbsp;511/Toca&nbsp;FC), acquired from Tocagen, is a two-part cancer-selective immunotherapy comprising an investigational gene therapy (Toca&nbsp;511) and an investigational small molecule (Toca&nbsp;FC). Toca&nbsp;511 is a retroviral replicating vector that selectively infects cancer cells and delivers a gene for the enzyme, cytosine deaminase (CD). Toca&nbsp;FC is an orally administered prodrug that is converted to an anti-cancer drug, 5–fluorouracil (5–FU), when it encounters CD. 5–FU kills cancer cells and immune-suppressive myeloid cells resulting in anti–cancer immune activation and subsequent tumor killing. The Toca&nbsp;511/Toca&nbsp;FC regimen has been tested clinically in recurrent high-grade glioma, most recently in a 403–patient Phase&nbsp;3 trial. <b>About Denovo Biopharma LLC<br class=""dnr""></b>Denovo Biopharma is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that uses novel biomarker approaches to re–evaluate medicines that have failed in broad patient populations. The company seeks to discover genomic biomarkers correlated with patients' responses to drug candidates retrospectively. Denovo then designs and executes efficient clinical trials in targeted patient populations to optimize the probability of a successful trial. Denovo has completed enrollment of patients in the US and <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> with diffuse large B–cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in a Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial and has an ongoing Phase&nbsp;3 trial in glioblastoma (GBM) for its lead product candidate, DB102 (enzastaurin), which was in–licensed from Eli Lilly &amp; Co. The company has seven additional late–stage programs targeting major unmet needs: DB103 (pomaglumetad methionil) for schizophrenia, DB104 (liafensine) for depression, DB105 (ORM–12741) for Alzheimer's Disease, DB106 (vosaroxin) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DB107 (Toca&nbsp;511/Toca&nbsp;FC) for recurrent high grade glioma, DB108 (endostatin) for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and DB109 (idalopirdine) for Alzheimer's Disease.

 - Use of a Pharmacogenomic to Retarget a Failed Clinical Trial with Liafensine in Depression - Case Study of an Exceptional Responder: Enzastaurin Long Term Efficacy in a Patient with Primary and Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) - DB102-01 ENGAGE Study: A biomarker-guided, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase 3 clinical trial of DB102 in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) - Extended benefits in patients with recurrent high grade glioma that continuously receive Toca FC after Toca 511 Treatment - A novel precision medicine approach to advance Toca 511 gene therapy News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:30 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">SAN DIEGO</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Denovo Biopharma LLC (Denovo), a pioneer in using biomarker-guided precision medicine to develop innovative therapies, today announced presentations at several conferences: one on DB104 (liafensine) at the CNS Summit (November&nbsp;7–10, 2021, <span class=""xn-location"">Boston, MA</span>, USA), two on DB102 (enzastaurin) and one on DB107 (Toca&nbsp;511/Toca&nbsp;FC) at the Society for NeuroOncology (SNO) Annual Meeting (November&nbsp;18–21, 2021, <span class=""xn-location"">Boston, MA</span>, USA), and one on DB107 at the International Oncolytic Virus Conference (IOVC) (November&nbsp;5–7, 2021, <span class=""xn-location"">Sedona, AZ</span>, USA). Podium presentation titled ""Use of a Pharmacogenomic Biomarker to Retarget a Failed Clinical Trial with Liafensine in Depression"" at the CNS Summit describes how Denovo identified the DGM4 pharmacogenomic biomarker that is predictive of efficacy of DB104 in patients with treatment-resistant depression, and also shows that DGM4 did not predict efficacy in patients receiving standard of care treatments and as such was specific to liafensine. Poster # CTNI-25 titled ""Case Study of an Exceptional Responder: Enzastaurin Long Term Efficacy in a Patient with Primary and Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)"" at SNO is a case study of a patient with primary and recurrent GBM who is an exceptional (15-year) responder to DB102. This patient was found to have DGM1, the pharmacogenomic biomarker discovered by Denovo that is associated with an increased survival in patients with GBM who are treated with DB102. Poster # CTNI-08 titled ""DB102-01 ENGAGE Study: A biomarker-guided, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase 3 clinical trial of DB102 in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)"" at SNO describes the Denovo-sponsored ENGAGE clinical trial in patients with newly-diagnosed GBM who are DGM1-positive, and who will receive DB102 in combination with standard of care treatment. Invited podium presentation titled ""A novel precision medicine approach to advance Toca&nbsp;511 gene therapy"" at IOVC covers the results of the Phase&nbsp;3 Toca5 clinical trial, and how a pharmacogenomic approach may guide future treatments of GBM with DB107. Poster #CTNI-03 titled ""Extended benefits in patients with recurrent high grade glioma that continuously receive Toca FC after Toca 511 Treatment"" at SNO covers seven patients with recurrent high grade glioma who have an extended benefit (ranging from 29 months to 7 years and 5 months) upon treatment with DB107 with six still remaining in treatment having either complete responses or stable disease. <b>About DB102 <br class=""dnr""></b>DB102 (enzastaurin) is an orally available first-in-class investigational small molecule, as a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor of the PKC beta, PI3K, and AKT pathways, that has been studied in over 3,000 patients with a range of solid and hematological tumor types. Enzastaurin was originally developed by Eli Lilly, and for which Denovo has acquired worldwide rights. Denovo discovered the novel pharmacogenomic biomarker DGM1<sup>TM</sup> and is conducting a Phase&nbsp;3 trial in patients with newly-diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and another Phase&nbsp;3 trial in newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Enzastaurin received Fast Track Designation for GBM from the FDA, Orphan Drug Designation for DLBCL and GBM from the FDA, and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation for DLBCL and GBM from the EMA. <b>About DB104 <br class=""dnr""></b>DB104 (liafensine) is an orally available first-in-class investigational small molecule, as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine triple reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI), that has been studied in over 2,000 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Liafensine was originally developed by Albany Molecular Research, Inc. (AMRI) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), and for which Denovo has acquired worldwide rights. Denovo discovered the novel pharmacogenomic biomarker DGM4<sup>TM</sup> and is planning a Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial. <b>About DB107 <br class=""dnr""></b>DB107 (Toca&nbsp;511/Toca&nbsp;FC), acquired from Tocagen, is a two-part cancer-selective immunotherapy comprising an investigational gene therapy (Toca&nbsp;511) and an investigational small molecule (Toca&nbsp;FC). Toca&nbsp;511 is a retroviral replicating vector that selectively infects cancer cells and delivers a gene for the enzyme, cytosine deaminase (CD). Toca&nbsp;FC is an orally administered prodrug that is converted to an anti-cancer drug, 5–fluorouracil (5–FU), when it encounters CD. 5–FU kills cancer cells and immune-suppressive myeloid cells resulting in anti–cancer immune activation and subsequent tumor killing. The Toca&nbsp;511/Toca&nbsp;FC regimen has been tested clinically in recurrent high-grade glioma, most recently in a 403–patient Phase&nbsp;3 trial. <b>About Denovo Biopharma LLC<br class=""dnr""></b>Denovo Biopharma is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that uses novel biomarker approaches to re–evaluate medicines that have failed in broad patient populations. The company seeks to discover genomic biomarkers correlated with patients' responses to drug candidates retrospectively. Denovo then designs and executes efficient clinical trials in targeted patient populations to optimize the probability of a successful trial. Denovo has completed enrollment of patients in the US and <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> with diffuse large B–cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in a Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial and has an ongoing Phase&nbsp;3 trial in glioblastoma (GBM) for its lead product candidate, DB102 (enzastaurin), which was in–licensed from Eli Lilly &amp; Co. The company has seven additional late–stage programs targeting major unmet needs: DB103 (pomaglumetad methionil) for schizophrenia, DB104 (liafensine) for depression, DB105 (ORM–12741) for Alzheimer's Disease, DB106 (vosaroxin) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), DB107 (Toca&nbsp;511/Toca&nbsp;FC) for recurrent high grade glioma, DB108 (endostatin) for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and DB109 (idalopirdine) for Alzheimer's Disease.

(""Parkway"" or the ""Company"") (OTC QX: PKKW) – the holding company for Skyline National Bank (""Skyline"" or the ""Bank"") – announced third quarter 2021 earnings.&nbsp;  Parkway recorded net income of <span class=""xn-money"">$2.7 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.45</span> per share, for the quarter ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> compared to net income of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.4 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.23</span> per share, for the same period in 2020.&nbsp; For the nine months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, net income was <span class=""xn-money"">$6.8 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$1.14</span> per share, compared to net income of <span class=""xn-money"">$4.2 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.69</span> per share, for the nine months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30</span>, 2020.&nbsp;  President and CEO <span class=""xn-person"">Blake Edwards</span> stated, ""We are pleased with our results for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2021.&nbsp; Third quarter earnings, on an annualized basis, represented a return on averages assets of 1.11% and a return on average equity of 12.13%. We continued to see pressure on our net interest margin from historically low interest rates and competitive loan pricing, however, this was partially offset by ongoing forgiveness on SBA-PPP loans which positively impacted interest income.&nbsp; I'm especially pleased to report that despite increased competition, our core loans (excluding SBA-PPP balances) grew over 8% from <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2020</span> to <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30</span>, 2021.&nbsp; Growth in our core loan balances will be key to replacing SBA-PPP related revenue as that program continues to wind down."" ""Deposit growth was strong as well with an increase of <span class=""xn-money"">$164.3 million</span>, or 23.00% over the past year.&nbsp; Customer balances have increased due to SBA-PPP proceeds and other government stimulus programs; however, a good portion of our growth came as a result of our expansion strategy in North Carolina.&nbsp; We opened four new branches in <span class=""xn-location"">North Carolina</span> between <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2019</span> and July 2020.&nbsp; Despite the challenges of opening branches in the midst of a pandemic, our deposit growth has exceeded our projections in all of our new locations as the Skyline brand continues to be very well received throughout our market area.&nbsp; Expense management has also been a priority as is reflected in our third quarter efficiency ratio of 63.45%.&nbsp; Our asset quality indicators remain strong and we continue to exercise our stock repurchase plan as opportunities arise."" Edwards concluded, ""Our strong performance throughout these challenging times is a direct reflection of the tremendous work that all of our employees have done and I could not be more proud of our entire Skyline family.&nbsp; They continue to deliver on our brand promise of being ""Always our Best"" for our customers each and every day.""  <b><i>Highlights</i></b> <b><i>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Response</i></b> <b><i>Third Quarter, First Nine Months of 2021 Income Statement Review</i></b> Net interest income after provision for loan losses in the third quarter of 2021 was <span class=""xn-money"">$7.9 million</span> compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$6.7 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting a provision for loan losses of <span class=""xn-money"">$219 thousand</span> in the 2021 period and <span class=""xn-money"">$291 thousand</span> in the third quarter of 2020.&nbsp; Total interest income was <span class=""xn-money"">$8.7 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021 compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$7.8 million</span> for the same period last year.&nbsp; Interest income on loans increased in the quarterly comparison primarily due to organic loan growth and SBA-PPP related interest and fees. Interest income on securities increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$216 thousand</span> in the quarterly comparison, as a result of the <span class=""xn-money"">$77.0 million</span> increase in the securities portfolio from <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2020</span> to <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>. The Company successfully reduced interest expense on deposits by <span class=""xn-money"">$292 thousand</span>, or 34.43%, in the quarterly comparison, reflecting continued rate reductions in deposit offerings.&nbsp; Lower-cost core deposits (demand deposits, savings, and money market accounts) grew by <span class=""xn-money"">$35.8 million</span>, or 5.55%, during the third quarter of 2021.&nbsp; The growth in core deposits is a result of organic growth in our current markets, with <span class=""xn-money"">$9.2 million</span> of the core deposit growth in the third quarter of 2021 attributed to our four newest branches opened in North Carolina.&nbsp;  For the first nine months of 2021, net interest income after provision for loan losses was <span class=""xn-money"">$22.7 million</span> compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$19.6 million</span> for the first nine months of 2020.&nbsp; Interest income increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$2.0 million</span>, primarily due to an increase in loan interest income of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.6 million</span> and a <span class=""xn-money"">$506 thousand</span> increase in interest from the securities portfolio during the first nine months of 2021, compared to the first nine months of 2020. &nbsp;Interest expense on deposits decreased by <span class=""xn-money"">$651 thousand</span> for the nine-months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> compared to the same period last year.&nbsp; As previously discussed, this is a reflection of the reduced rates for interest bearing demand deposits, time deposits, and savings products. Total noninterest income was <span class=""xn-money"">$1.8 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021 compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$1.4 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020.&nbsp; The increase was primarily a result of an increase in service charges and fees of <span class=""xn-money"">$196 thousand</span>, an increase in realized gains on securities of <span class=""xn-money"">$162 thousand</span>, and an increase in mortgage origination fees of <span class=""xn-money"">$90 thousand</span>.&nbsp; For the first nine months of 2021, noninterest income increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$816 thousand</span> compared to the same period last year.&nbsp; The increase was mainly due to an increase in mortgage origination income of <span class=""xn-money"">$295 thousand</span> and an increase in service charges and fees of <span class=""xn-money"">$389 thousand</span>.&nbsp; During the first nine months of 2021, there were realized gains on securities of <span class=""xn-money"">$265 thousand</span>, compared to realized gains on securities of <span class=""xn-money"">$315 thousand</span> for the first nine months of 2020, representing a decrease of <span class=""xn-money"">$50 thousand</span>.&nbsp; During the first nine months of 2021, the Company had a one-time lease termination fee of <span class=""xn-money"">$200 thousand</span>. &nbsp;&nbsp; Total noninterest expenses were <span class=""xn-money"">$6.3 million</span> for the quarters ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> and 2020, respectively.&nbsp; Salary and benefit costs increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$55 thousand</span>, while occupancy and equipment expenses increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$55 thousand</span>.&nbsp; Data processing expenses increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$18 thousand</span>, professional fees decreased by <span class=""xn-money"">$21 thousand</span>, and advertising expenses decreased by <span class=""xn-money"">$20 thousand</span> in the quarter-to-quarter comparison.&nbsp; &nbsp;For the nine-month period ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, total noninterest expenses increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$558 thousand</span> compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to employee and branch costs associated with branch expansion. Salary and benefit cost increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$161 thousand</span>, occupancy and equipment expenses increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$286 thousand</span>, and data processing expenses increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$101 thousand</span> from the first nine months of 2020 to 2021.&nbsp; Professional fees increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$80 thousand</span> which was offset by a decrease in core deposit intangible amortization of <span class=""xn-money"">$87 thousand</span> from the first nine months of 2020 to 2021. Income tax expense increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$343 thousand</span> in the quarter-to-quarter comparison, and <span class=""xn-money"">$719 thousand</span> in the nine-month period comparisons.&nbsp; The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income before taxes of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.6 million</span> in the quarterly comparison, and a <span class=""xn-money"">$3.4 million</span> increase in the nine-month comparison. <b><i>Balance Sheet Review</i></b> Total assets increased in the third quarter of 2021 by <span class=""xn-money"">$33.3 million</span>, or 3.51%, to <span class=""xn-money"">$980.2 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> from <span class=""xn-money"">$946.9 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">June 30, 2021</span>, and increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$124.8 million</span>, or 14.59%, from <span class=""xn-money"">$855.4 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31</span>, 2020.&nbsp; The increase in total assets during the quarter can be primarily attributed to the <span class=""xn-money"">$32.0 million</span> increase in deposits.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total loans decreased during the third quarter by <span class=""xn-money"">$11.3 million</span>, or 1.61%, to <span class=""xn-money"">$686.1 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> from <span class=""xn-money"">$697.4 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">June 30, 2021</span>, and increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$22.0 million</span>, or 3.32%, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$664.1 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31</span>, 2020.&nbsp; SBA-PPP loans decreased by <span class=""xn-money"">$23.7 million</span> during the third quarter 2021; however, this decrease was partially offset by higher yielding organic loan growth of <span class=""xn-money"">$12.8 million</span> during the quarter.&nbsp; Gross loans at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> included <span class=""xn-money"">$40.8 million</span> in SBA-PPP loans with net deferred fees of <span class=""xn-money"">$3.0 million</span>.&nbsp;  Asset quality has remained strong, with a ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans of 0.30% at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> compared to 0.73% at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30</span>, 2020.&nbsp; The allowance for loan losses at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> was approximately 0.81% of total loans, compared to 0.71% at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2020</span>. The allowance ratio excluding <span class=""xn-money"">$37.8 million</span> of SBA-PPP loans would have been 0.86% at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30</span>, 2021.&nbsp; Management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the acquired Cardinal Bankshares Corporation and Great State Bank loan portfolios was reflected as a purchase discount which will continue to be accreted into income over the remaining life of the acquired loans.&nbsp; As of <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, the remaining unaccreted discount on the acquired loan portfolios totaled <span class=""xn-money"">$1.2 million</span>.  Investment securities increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$4.5 million</span> during the third quarter to <span class=""xn-money"">$107.4 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> from <span class=""xn-money"">$102.9 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">June 30, 2021</span>, and increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$73.9 million</span> from <span class=""xn-money"">$33.5 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31</span>, 2020.&nbsp; &nbsp;The increase in the third quarter of 2021 was the result of <span class=""xn-money"">$16.4 million</span> in purchases, offset by sales of <span class=""xn-money"">$8.6 million</span>, paydowns of <span class=""xn-money"">$2.3 million</span>, and maturities/calls of <span class=""xn-money"">$900 thousand</span>.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total deposits increased in the third quarter of 2021 by <span class=""xn-money"">$32.0 million</span>, or 3.77%, to <span class=""xn-money"">$878.3 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> from <span class=""xn-money"">$846.3 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">June 30, 2021</span>, and increased <span class=""xn-money"">$122.8 million</span>, or 16.24%, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$755.5 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31</span>, 2020.&nbsp; Total deposits increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$164.3 million</span>, or 23.00%, from <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2020</span> to <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30</span>, 2021.&nbsp; The increases in deposit balances came as a result of the Bank's participation in the SBA-PPP program, government stimulus programs, branch expansion into new markets, and growth in our existing locations.&nbsp; Total increases for the third quarter of 2021 included a <span class=""xn-money"">$16.4 million</span> increase in noninterest bearing deposits, while interest bearing deposits increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$15.5 million</span> over the same time period.&nbsp; The increase in interest bearing deposits was due to a <span class=""xn-money"">$15.4 million</span> increase in money markets, a <span class=""xn-money"">$7.5 million</span> increase in saving accounts, offset by a <span class=""xn-money"">$3.5 million</span> decrease in interest-bearing demand deposits and a <span class=""xn-money"">$3.9 million</span> decrease in time deposits.&nbsp; Stockholders' equity increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$1.3 million</span>, or 1.53%, to <span class=""xn-money"">$88.4 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> from <span class=""xn-money"">$87.1 million</span> three months earlier, and increased <span class=""xn-money"">$3.3 million</span>, or 3.85%, from <span class=""xn-money"">$85.1 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31</span>, 2020.&nbsp; The increase during the quarter was due to earnings of <span class=""xn-money"">$2.7 million</span>, offset by a <span class=""xn-money"">$125 thousand</span> change in unrealized losses during the quarter, stock repurchases of <span class=""xn-money"">$420 thousand</span> and dividends paid of <span class=""xn-money"">$839 thousand</span>.&nbsp; Book value increased from <span class=""xn-money"">$14.08</span> per share at <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2020</span>, and <span class=""xn-money"">$14.47</span> per share at <span class=""xn-chron"">June 30, 2021</span>, to <span class=""xn-money"">$14.78</span> per share at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>. <b>Forward-looking statements</b> This release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934 as amended.

 Mr. Borutta has thrived as the chief executive officer of a major industrial equipment manufacturer News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:25 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">PINEVILLE, N.C.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- <span class=""xn-person"">Martin Borutta</span> is a distinguished biographee of Marquis Who's Who. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are chosen from among a pool of the most prominent professionals and are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process. Born in <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, Mr. Borutta began his professional career as the technical director for the U2 Office of Buromobelfabrik GmbH &amp; Co. from 1993 until 1995. During this period, he also earned a diploma in automotive engineering from the <span class=""xn-location"">Munich</span> <span class=""xn-org"">University of Applied Sciences</span>. Mr. Borutta subsequently advanced to become the technical director for the Trend Office of Buromobelfabrik GmbH &amp; Co., which is a manufacturer of executive office desks, conference room equipment and other office furniture.  From 1996 until 1997, Mr. Borutta excelled as the technical director for Topstar Möbel GmbH in Langenneufnach, <span class=""xn-location"">Germany</span>, before returning to the Trend Office of Buromobelfabrik GmbH &amp; Co. to serve as the chief executive officer. After thriving in this capacity for three years, he found further success as the chief executive officer of The Joy@Office Consulting from 2000 until 2003. Towards the beginning of this period, Mr. Borutta concluded his education by obtaining a Master of Business Administration from the University of Augsburg and the Katz Business School in <span class=""xn-location"">Pittsburgh, PA.</span>  Thanks to his stellar reputation in the German industrial machinery and equipment space, Mr. Borutta was appointed as the chief executive officer of TTK Technology GmbH from 2003 until 2007. Throughout the following eight years, he harnessed his innovative mindset to serve as the chief visionary officer of ROFA Industrial Automation AG. Mr. Borutta subsequently capitalized on his vast professional network to launch his own strategic consulting business in 2015.  The following year, he was recruited as the chief executive officer of TEUPEN Machinenbau GmbH, which is widely known as a leading manufacturer of compact tracked lifts and other aerial work platforms. Though he oversees operations throughout the entire organization, Mr. Borutta currently works at TEUPEN's U.S. headquarters in <span class=""xn-location"">Charlotte, North Carolina</span>, and focuses on marketing their signature products to U.S. businesses. He additionally plays a central role in the research and development process in regard to new products. In 2017 Mr. Borutta acquired shares of the TEUPEN group and is actually the single largest shareholder of TEUPEN. Mr. Borutta attributes a great deal of his success to his knowledge of advanced technology, which enables TEUPEN to maintain a sizable advantage over their competitors. Since his relationships with his colleagues and business partners have also contributed to his professional growth, he advises aspiring business executives to treat their peers with kindness and respect. Throughout his career, Mr. Borutta has consistently prioritized the needs of other people over his own.  In the coming years, Mr. Borutta intends to significantly increase TEUPEN's presence in the U.S. and <span class=""xn-location"">Asia</span> by introducing a series of new developed products. He believes that his industry as a whole must devote more attention to protecting the environment in order to expand into new markets. In his spare time, Mr. Borutta enjoys sailing, hunting, traveling and motorsports. About Marquis Who's Who<sup>®</sup>: Since 1899, when A. N.

 Fiscal 2021 Share Repurchases to Increase from $325M to $625M Current Repurchase Authorization of $1B to Be Completed by End of Fiscal 2021 Accelerating Fiscal 2022-2023 Plans News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:19 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">UNION, N.J.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bed-bath--beyond-inc-advances-1-billion-three-year-share-repurchase-program-within-fiscal-2021-301414529.html#financial-modal"">BBBY</a>) today announced that it expects to complete its <span class=""xn-money"">$1 billion</span> three-year share repurchase plan by the end of fiscal 2021, two years ahead of schedule. Program-to-date, the Company has completed <span class=""xn-money"">$600 million</span> in share repurchases since the end of fiscal 2020.&nbsp; The Company now expects to repurchase the remaining <span class=""xn-money"">$400 million</span> of the program by the end of fiscal 2021, specifically over the third and fourth quarters.&nbsp;  <span class=""xn-person"">Mark Tritton</span>, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's President and CEO commented, ""We continue to execute our bold transformation and implement successful strategies that will fortify our near-term and long-term value creation. Today's announcement further underscores our ongoing confidence in our turnaround, and our ability to simultaneously generate positive cash flow, maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in our long-term growth, all while returning significant capital to shareholders.&nbsp; We remain committed to our capital allocation framework of delivering strong and sustainable total shareholder return."" Mr. Tritton continued, ""As we continue to navigate the third quarter, the corrective and surgical pricing actions we've implemented are resulting in a trend toward expected gross margin rates for the period.&nbsp; Sales to date have remained consistent with the September trends we shared on our earnings call several weeks ago.&nbsp; Our focus remains on delivering comp sales growth in the all-important November month, which represents a disproportionately larger impact to our quarterly sales.&nbsp; We are preparing for the peak Holiday season and are particularly excited about the new future sales channels that we've announced today, which are our strategic collaboration with Kroger and our own digital Marketplace."" During the first six months of the current fiscal year, the Company has executed approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$225 million</span> in repurchases with <span class=""xn-money"">$100 million</span> remaining under its <span class=""xn-money"">$325 million</span> plan for fiscal 2021.&nbsp; With today's announcement, the total expected share repurchase amount for fiscal 2021 has now increased to approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$625 million</span>, nearly doubling the initial share repurchase plan of <span class=""xn-money"">$325 million</span> for the current fiscal year.&nbsp;  <span class=""prnews_span""><b>FY20</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>FY21</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>TOTAL PROGRAM</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Q1-Q2</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Q3-Q4</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Total</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">To Date</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Remaining</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Total</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Share Repurchases</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$375M</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$225M</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$400M</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$625M</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$600M</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$400M</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$1B</span> This expedited and revised share repurchase plan is consistent with the Company's capital allocation principles of investing for growth and transformation, ensuring financial resilience, and returning cash to shareholders.&nbsp; As of <span class=""xn-chron"">August 28, 2021</span>, total liquidity was approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$2.0 billion</span>, including the Company's asset based revolving credit facility.  The method, timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.&nbsp; The Company does not anticipate today's announcement to have a significant impact in fiscal 2021. <b>About Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</b> Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") is an omnichannel retailer that makes it easy for our customers to feel at home.

The estimated blended year-one FFO yield across the assemblage is 4.2%.  Healthpeak intends to capitalize on robust market fundamentals and tenant demand through the development of multiple Class A life science buildings over the next decade-plus, extending our leading position in <span class=""xn-location"">West Cambridge</span>. This 36 acre campus has convenient access to the Alewife T station, Route 2, and the Minuteman Bike Trail, which link <span class=""xn-location"">Cambridge</span>, downtown <span class=""xn-location"">Boston</span>, and the western suburbs.  Alewife Submarket Acquisitions Overview: For additional detail on the <span class=""xn-location"">West Cambridge</span> assemblage, please refer to the West Cambridge &amp; South San Francisco Transaction Update presentation available in the Investor Relations section of our website at <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3343370-1&amp;h=3730146823&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fir.healthpeak.com%2Finvestor-presentations&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fir.healthpeak.com%2Finvestor-presentations"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://ir.healthpeak.com/investor-presentations</a>. <i>VISTA <span class=""xn-person"">SORRENTO CAMPUS</span>, SORRENTO MESA</i> In October, Healthpeak closed on an off-market acquisition in the Sorrento Mesa submarket of <span class=""xn-location"">San Diego</span> for <span class=""xn-money"">$20 million</span>. The Vista Sorrento campus consists of a 63,000 square foot office building on five acres of land. Following the near-term expirations of the in-place leases, Healthpeak intends to commence construction of a new Class A life science development. The Vista Sorrento site is across the street from Healthpeak's 250,000 square foot Sorrento Summit Campus. <u>NEW MOB ACQUISITIONS </u> Since our last earnings call, Healthpeak announced it acquired 232,000 square feet of on-campus MOBs for an aggregate <span class=""xn-money"">$137 million</span>. The Baylor and <span class=""xn-location"">Lakeview</span> acquisitions represent a blended stabilized Cash NOI capitalization rate of 5%, while the covered land acquisition in <span class=""xn-location"">Seattle</span> represents a 4% year-one Cash NOI capitalization rate.  <i>BAYLOR MOBs&nbsp;&nbsp; </i> In September, Healthpeak acquired two Class A, on-campus MOBs totaling 138,000 square feet for <span class=""xn-money"">$60 million</span> in an off-market transaction. The properties are 89% occupied and are the only two MOBs on the campus of <span class=""xn-person"">Baylor Scott</span> &amp; White's 118-bed hospital in <span class=""xn-location"">Frisco, Texas</span>. <span class=""xn-person"">Baylor Scott</span> &amp; White (Moody's: Aa3) is ranked the #2 health system in the Dallas MSA and leases 37% of the properties' square footage. The acquisition adds to our market-leading MOB position in <span class=""xn-location"">Dallas</span>, bringing Healthpeak's ownership to over 4 million square feet in the MSA. <i><span class=""xn-location"">LAKEVIEW</span> MOB </i> In October, Healthpeak acquired Lakeview Medical Pavilion, a 55,000 square foot on-campus MOB for <span class=""xn-money"">$34 million</span> in an off-market transaction. The property is on the campus of a 167-bed HCA hospital in <span class=""xn-location"">Covington, Louisiana</span>, part of the New Orleans MSA. The property, built in 2014, is 100% occupied with a weighted average lease term of 7 years.&nbsp;  <i>SWEDISH MEDICAL MOB </i> In October, Healthpeak acquired 700 Broadway, a 39,000 square foot on-campus MOB located in the downtown <span class=""xn-location"">Seattle</span> healthcare cluster known as ""First Hill"" for <span class=""xn-money"">$43 million</span>. The property is on the campus of Swedish Medical Center and connected via an underground tunnel to the hospital. The property is 100% leased to Northwest Kidney Centers, the world's first dialysis organization. The site includes structured and surface parking, providing future densification opportunities. The acquisition brings Healthpeak's total square footage on the campus of Swedish Medical Center to 610,000 square feet with a current occupancy of approximately 97%. <u>PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED MOB ACQUISITIONS</u> <i>ATLANTIC HEALTH MOBs </i> In <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2021</span>, Healthpeak acquired three buildings totaling 537,000 square feet for <span class=""xn-money"">$155 million</span> in an off-market transaction. The properties are located in <span class=""xn-location"">Morristown, New Jersey</span> and are 100% leased to Atlantic Health System, the leading health system in <span class=""xn-location"">New Jersey</span>, under triple-net leases with approximately 11 years of remaining lease term. The transaction also includes an adjacent land parcel that can support up to 80,000 square feet of medical office development.  <i>HCA WESLEY WOODLAWN MOB </i> In <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2021</span>, Healthpeak acquired <span class=""xn-person"">Wesley Woodlawn</span> located in <span class=""xn-location"">Wichita, Kansas</span> for <span class=""xn-money"">$50 million</span>. The 132,000 square foot medical campus is 100% leased to HCA with approximately 6 years of remaining lease term.  <b>LIFE SCIENCE DEVELOPMENT LEASING UPDATES&nbsp;&nbsp; </b> <i>THE SHORE </i> Interline Therapeutics, Inc. has signed a lease for the remaining 36,000 square feet at Phase II of The Shore at Sierra Point, bringing the entire 629,000 square foot campus to 100% leased or pre-leased. The lease is expected to commence in late 2022 upon completion of construction. <i>101 CAMBRIDGEPARK DRIVE </i> eGenesis, Inc. and Seres Therapeutics, Inc.&nbsp;have signed leases for a combined 142,000 square feet at 101 CambridgePark Drive, bringing the <span class=""xn-money"">$180 million</span>, 161,000 square foot development to 88% pre-leased. When combined with our adjacent life science holdings at 35 and 87 CambridgePark Drive, Healthpeak has created a flagship 449,000 square foot campus in the heart of <span class=""xn-location"">West Cambridge</span>. <b>VANTAGE DEVELOPMENT START&nbsp;&nbsp; </b> In October, Healthpeak commenced the first phase of its next <span class=""xn-location"">South San Francisco</span> life science development project, Vantage. Strategically located on the corner of Forbes Boulevard and at the door-step of Genentech's headquarters, the first phase of the development will include approximately 343,000 square feet, with total project costs of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$393 million</span>. The purpose-built lab campus will feature state-of-the-art design, an amenity center, flexible and efficient floor plates, and building systems that will accommodate a broad range of life science uses. Expected initial occupancy is in the second half of 2023. Healthpeak expects to pursue additional entitlements for the remaining acreage on the Vantage land site, enabling the development of a multi-phase campus totaling one million square feet based on existing zoning, with the potential for significantly more subject to entitlements. <b>BALANCE SHEET </b> In September, Healthpeak closed on an upsized <span class=""xn-money"">$3 billion</span> revolving credit facility extending maturity to 2026.&nbsp; During the third quarter, Healthpeak sold 9.1 million shares of common stock under the ATM equity offering program on a forward basis at an average price of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$35.60</span> per share (before underwriting discounts), which is expected to result in net proceeds of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$320 million</span>. <b>SENIOR HOUSING DISPOSITIONS</b> Subsequent to our <span class=""xn-chron"">August 2, 2021</span> earnings release, Healthpeak closed on a total of <span class=""xn-money"">$149 million</span> of senior housing sales and loan repayments, bringing cumulative gross proceeds to <span class=""xn-money"">$4 billion</span> since <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2020</span>. Following completion of the identified senior housing dispositions, Healthpeak's remaining rental senior housing exposure consists solely of a 53.5% interest in a 19-property senior housing joint venture.  <b>DIVIDEND &nbsp;</b> On <span class=""xn-chron"">October 27</span>, Healthpeak announced that its Board declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.30</span> per share to be paid on <span class=""xn-chron"">November 19, 2021</span>, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on <span class=""xn-chron"">November 8, 2021</span>. <b>ESG </b> Healthpeak received the Green Star designation from GRESB and was named a constituent in the FTSE4Good Index, each for the tenth consecutive year.

Newly acquired operating assets are generally considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up (typically when the tenant(s) control(s) the physical use of at least 80% of the space) or 12 months from the acquisition date. Newly completed developments are considered stabilized at the earlier of lease-up or 24 months from the date the property is placed in service. The aggregate NOI or Cash (Adjusted) NOI projections used in calculating the capitalization rates and yield ranges included in this presentation are based on (i) information currently available to us, including, in connection with acquisitions, information made available to us by the seller in the diligence process, and (ii) certain assumptions applied by us related to anticipated occupancy, rental rates, property taxes and other expenses over a specified period of time in the future based on historical data and the Company's knowledge of and experience with the submarket. Accordingly, the capitalization rates and yield ranges included in this presentation are inherently based on inexact projections that may be incorrect or imprecise and may change as a result of events or factors currently unknown to the Company. The actual capitalization rates for these properties may differ materially and adversely from the estimated stabilized capitalization rates and yield ranges discussed in this release based on numerous factors, including any difficulties achieving assumed occupancy and/or rental rates, development delays, unanticipated expenses not payable by a tenant, tenant defaults, the results of purchase price allocations, as well as the risk factors set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2020</span> and its subsequent filings with the SEC. <b>CONTACT <br class=""dnr""></b><span class=""xn-person"">Andrew Johns</span>, CFA <br class=""dnr"">Vice President – Corporate Finance and Investor Relations <br class=""dnr"">720-428-5400

Financial Measures</b> EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share as presented herein are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> (""GAAP""). They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that these measures provide investors additional meaningful methods to evaluate certain aspects of the company's results period over period and for the other reasons set forth below. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus interest expense net of interest income, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for the items of income and expense and expected incremental revenue and cost savings as described in our senior secured credit agreement covenant calculations. Management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about one of the principal measures of performance used by our creditors. In addition, management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our performance.  Depreciation expense for property and equipment and amortization expense of capitalized internally developed software costs relate to ongoing capital expenditures; however, amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, such as customer relationships, software, tradenames and noncompete agreements are not representative of ongoing capital expenditures, but have a continuing effect on our reported results. Non-GAAP financial measures of operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share, in the opinion of the company, provide comparability of the company's performance to other companies that may not have incurred these types of non-cash expenses or that report a similar measure. In addition, operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share may include adjustments for certain other charges.  EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results as reported under GAAP. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following table reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the periods presented: <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Three Months Ended</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>September 30,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Nine Months Ended</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>September 30,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(<i>in millions</i>), (<i>unaudited</i>)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Net income (loss)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(1.0)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">47.1</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>61.4</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">17.6</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Add back:</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Income taxes</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(1.2)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">10.9</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>31.5</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">8.3</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Interest expense, net of interest income</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>32.0</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">29.2</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>93.7</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">97.0</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Depreciation and amortization</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>44.7</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">46.5</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>137.1</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">140.7</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>EBITDA</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>74.5</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">133.7</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>323.7</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">263.6</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Non-cash stock-based compensation</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>4.3</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">3.9</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>14.8</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">12.1</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Acquisition related costs</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2.4</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">2.4</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>5.7</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">4.7</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Securitization interest</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(7.9)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(3.7)</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(21.5)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(21.1)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(Gain)/Loss on asset sales</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(3.8)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">0.1</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(3.6)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1.1</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Severance</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>1.7</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">2.3</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>3.6</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">10.6</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Foreign currency (gains)/losses</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>0.1</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">0.1</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2.7</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">3.2</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Goodwill and other intangibles impairment</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>—</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">—</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>—</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">29.8</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Contingent consideration adjustment</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>4.4</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">—</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>20.1</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">—</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Net change in unrealized gains on investment securities</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>20.9</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">—</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(10.7)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">—</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Other</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>—</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">0.4</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>1.5</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">3.8</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp;

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:15 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">THE WOODLANDS, Texas</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;Newpark Resources, Inc. (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newpark-resources-reports-third-quarter-2021-results-301414468.html#financial-modal"">NR</a>) (""Newpark"" or the ""Company"") today announced results for its third quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2021. Total revenues for the third quarter of 2021 were <span class=""xn-money"">$151.8 million</span> compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$142.2 million</span> for the second quarter of 2021 and <span class=""xn-money"">$96.4 million</span> for the third quarter of 2020. Net loss for the third quarter of 2021 was <span class=""xn-money"">$10</span>.5&nbsp;million, or <span class=""xn-money"">($0.11)</span> per share, compared to a net loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$6.0 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">($0.07)</span> per share, for the second quarter of 2021, and a net loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$23.9 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">($0.26)</span> per share, for the third quarter of 2020.  Third quarter 2021 operating results include the impact of <span class=""xn-money"">$4.0 million</span> of pre-tax charges, all in the Fluids Systems segment (<span class=""xn-money"">$0.04</span> per share after-tax), primarily related to self-insured costs associated with Hurricane Ida and restructuring related costs. <span class=""xn-person"">Paul Howes</span>, Newpark's Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""Although we faced some continued market challenges during the third quarter, including the impact of Hurricane Ida and the lingering COVID-related impact on our international operations, we are encouraged by the improving market dynamics in the oil and gas sector and remain focused on our ongoing efforts to scale our U.S. Fluids Systems business. Consolidated revenues improved 7% sequentially to <span class=""xn-money"">$152 million</span>, benefitting from continued strength in Site and Access Solutions product sales along with an 11% improvement in Fluids Systems revenues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ""Our Industrial Solutions business performance continues to demonstrate the value of our diversification efforts, as we expand our presence in the power transmission and other industrial end-markets. While the third quarter was impacted by the typical seasonal slowdown in T&amp;D rental project activity, this seasonal lull was largely offset by a <span class=""xn-money"">$4 million</span> increase in site access product sales, reflecting the benefit of our expanding customer base within the utility sector. With the modestly lower revenue and shift in revenue mix, our Industrial Solutions operating margin declined to 18% in the third quarter.""  Howes continued, ""In the Fluids Systems segment, revenues improved 11% sequentially, primarily driven by strength in <span class=""xn-location"">Canada</span> and other international markets. <span class=""xn-location"">North America</span> revenues improved by 14% sequentially to <span class=""xn-money"">$71 million</span>, substantially all driven by the Canadian market. U.S. revenues remained in-line with prior quarter, with modest improvement in land activity offset by a <span class=""xn-money"">$2 million</span> weather-driven decline in the <span class=""xn-location"">Gulf of Mexico</span>. International revenues improved 6% sequentially to <span class=""xn-money"">$37 million</span> in the third quarter, with our expansion in <span class=""xn-location"">Asia Pacific</span> being the primary driver of the improvement. Benefitting from the revenue improvement and our ongoing actions to reshape the U.S. business for a structurally smaller market, the Fluids Systems segment made meaningful progress towards a return to positive cash flow generation, however, this improvement was offset by <span class=""xn-money"">$4.0 million</span> of third quarter charges associated with Hurricane Ida and restructuring efforts. ""With the improvement in revenues and timing of customer activities within the quarter, we used <span class=""xn-money"">$14 million</span> of cash in the third quarter to fund a net working capital increase. The majority of the working capital increase reflects an increase in international receivable DSO's, which we expect will normalize going forward,"" added Howes. ""We also made <span class=""xn-money"">$6 million</span> of net capital investments in the third quarter, substantially all to expand our mat rental fleet in support of our pipeline of fourth quarter power transmission rental projects."" <b><i>Segment Results</i></b> The Fluids Systems segment generated revenues of <span class=""xn-money"">$108.0 million</span> for the third quarter of 2021 compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$97.1 million</span> for the second quarter of 2021 and <span class=""xn-money"">$67.7 million</span> for the third quarter of 2020. Segment operating loss was <span class=""xn-money"">$6</span>.6&nbsp;million for the third quarter of 2021 compared to an operating loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$6.5 million</span> for the second quarter of 2021 and an operating loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$19.0 million</span> for the third quarter of 2020. Operating loss for the third quarter of 2021 includes <span class=""xn-money"">$4.0 million</span> of charges primarily related to self-insured costs associated with Hurricane Ida damage to our Fourchon, Louisiana Fluids Systems operating base, facility exit, and severance costs. Operating loss for the second quarter of 2021 included <span class=""xn-money"">$0.6 million</span> of charges related to severance costs. Operating loss for the third quarter of 2020 included <span class=""xn-money"">$4.5 million</span> of charges primarily related to the impairment of certain fixed assets and other non-cash charges. The Industrial Solutions segment generated revenues of <span class=""xn-money"">$43.8 million</span> for the third quarter of 2021 compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$45.2 million</span> for the second quarter of 2021 and <span class=""xn-money"">$28.7 million</span> for the third quarter of 2020. Segment operating income was <span class=""xn-money"">$8.1 million</span> for the third quarter of 2021 compared to operating income of <span class=""xn-money"">$10.1 million</span> for the second quarter of 2021 and operating loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.1 million</span> for the third quarter of 2020. Operating income for the second quarter of 2021 included a <span class=""xn-money"">$1.0 million</span> gain related to a legal settlement. <b><i>Conference Call</i></b> Newpark has scheduled a conference call to discuss third quarter of 2021 results and its near-term operational outlook, which will be broadcast live over the Internet, on <span class=""xn-chron"">Wednesday, November 3, 2021</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">10:00 a.m. Eastern Time</span> / <span class=""xn-chron"">9:00 a.m. Central Time</span>.

 Increases 2021 Financial Guidance News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:15 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">TULSA, Okla.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oneok-announces-26-year-over-year-increase-in-third-quarter-2021-net-income-and-earnings-per-share-301414490.html#financial-modal"">OKE</a>) today announced higher third quarter 2021 results and increased 2021 financial guidance. <b><u>Higher Third Quarter 2021 Results, Compared With Third Quarter 2020:</u> </b> <b><u>Increased 2021 Guidance:</u></b> ONEOK increased 2021 net income guidance to a range of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.43 billion</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$1.55 billion</span>, compared with the previously announced range of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.20 billion</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$1.50 billion</span>. Adjusted EBITDA guidance increased to a range of <span class=""xn-money"">$3.325 billion</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$3.425 billion</span>, compared with ONEOK's previously announced range of <span class=""xn-money"">$3.05 billion</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$3.35 billion</span>. The increase in financial guidance reflects continued strength in Rocky Mountain region volumes and higher commodity prices in the natural gas gathering and processing segment. NGL volume growth in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin, and higher natural gas sales and firm transportation revenue also contributed to increased 2021 expectations. ""ONEOK's strong third quarter results were driven by NGL and natural gas volume growth on our system, contributing higher fee-based earnings,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Pierce H. Norton II</span>, ONEOK president and chief executive officer. ""Increasing producer activity driven by improving market demand resulted in record NGL raw feed throughput volumes on our system. These factors, combined with year-to-date results, contributed to the increase in our 2021 financial guidance, giving us positive momentum going into next year. ""The third quarter also marked another milestone in ONEOK's commitment to environmental responsibility with our announcement of a greenhouse gas emission absolute reduction target,"" added Norton. ""We continue to evaluate lower-carbon opportunities that will complement our operations and provide long-term stakeholder value."" <b><u>THIRD QUARTER 2021 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS</u></b> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Three Months Ended</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Nine Months Ended</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>September 30,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>September 30,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(<i>Millions of dollars, except per share amounts</i>)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Net income (a)</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>392.0</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">312.3</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>1,120.3</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">304.8</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Diluted earnings per common share (a)</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>0.88</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">0.70</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2.50</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">0.71</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Adjusted EBITDA (b) (c)</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>865.2</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">747.0</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2,533.1</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,981.7</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Operating income (d)</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>667.9</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">550.4</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>1,944.1</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">822.7</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Operating costs</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>265.2</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">205.0</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>770.9</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">636.5</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Depreciation and amortization</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>154.5</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">153.2</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>468.6</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">426.0</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Equity in net earnings from investments</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>28.6</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">38.0</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>87.6</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">108.0</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Maintenance capital</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>42.3</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">31.8</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>113.5</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">83.2</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Capital expenditures (includes maintenance)</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>166.2</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">380.0</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>490.3</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,924.0</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(a) Amounts for the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020, include benefits of $2.2 million and $22.2 million, respectively, related to net gains on open market repurchases of debt.

Results also benefited from the prior year impact of lower realized commodity prices in the third quarter 2020 in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, compared with the third quarter 2021. Results included higher operating costs from higher employee-related costs, higher materials, supplies and outside services expenses and increased property taxes.  <b><u>HIGHLIGHTS:</u></b>

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, noncash compensation expense, allowance for equity funds used during construction (equity AFUDC), and other noncash items. Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it, and similar measures, is used by many companies in the industry as a measure of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate ONEOK's financial performance and to compare the company's financial performance with the performance of other companies within the industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA is included in the tables. ONEOK, Inc.

Sales increased 28.6 percent to <span class=""xn-money"">$112.3 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$87.3 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020.&nbsp; Persistency in Colonial Life was 78.9 percent for the first nine months of 2021, compared to 77.6 percent for the first nine months of 2020. <b><i><u>Closed Block Segment</u></i></b> The Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of <span class=""xn-money"">$109.8 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021, which excludes the reserve increases related to reserve assumption updates of <span class=""xn-money"">$33</span>.6&nbsp;million, primarily related to the closed group pension block, as well as the amortization of cost of reinsurance related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction of <span class=""xn-money"">$19.7 million</span>, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$70.8 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020.&nbsp; Premium income for this segment was <span class=""xn-money"">$250.5 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021, which was generally consistent with the third quarter of 2020, due to rate increases on certain in-force business in the long-term care line of business mostly offset by policy terminations and maturities.&nbsp; Net investment income decreased 19.0 percent to <span class=""xn-money"">$284.6 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$351.2 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020, due to a decrease in the level of invested assets supporting the individual disability line of business resulting from the reinsurance transaction that occurred in the first quarter of 2021 and fourth quarter of 2020, as well as a decline in the yield on invested assets.&nbsp; These decreases were partially offset by higher miscellaneous investment income, primarily related to increases in the net asset values on our private equity partnerships. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business was 74.8 percent in the third quarter of 2021, excluding the reserve increase related to the assumption update, compared to an interest adjusted loss ratio of 67.4 percent in the third quarter of 2020, driven by lower claimant mortality and higher submitted claims. The interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care for the rolling twelve months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, excluding the reserve increases related to the assumption updates, was 71.8 percent which is below our long-term expected range.&nbsp; The interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability line of business, excluding the reserve increase related to the assumption update, was 58.2 percent in the third quarter of 2021, compared to 86.6 percent in the third quarter of 2020, driven primarily by lower submitted claims. <b><i><u>Corporate Segment</u></i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Corporate segment reported an adjusted operating loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$45.4 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021, which excludes the before-tax impairment loss on internal-use software of <span class=""xn-money"">$12.1 million</span>, compared to an adjusted operating loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$54.1 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020, which excludes the costs related to an organizational design update of <span class=""xn-money"">$23.3 million</span>. <b><u>OTHER INFORMATION</u></b> <b><i><u>Shares Outstanding</u></i></b> The Company's weighted average number of shares outstanding, assuming dilution, was 205.1 million for the third quarter of 2021, compared to 203.9 million for the third quarter of 2020.&nbsp; Shares outstanding totaled 204.4 million at September&nbsp;30, 2021.&nbsp; The Company did not repurchase shares during the first nine months of 2021.&nbsp;  On <span class=""xn-chron"">October 25, 2021</span>, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to <span class=""xn-money"">$250.0 million</span> of Unum Group's outstanding common stock through <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2022</span>, with the timing and amount of repurchase activity to be based on market conditions and other considerations, including the level of available cash, alternative uses for cash, and our stock price.&nbsp; The Company intends to execute an accelerated stock repurchase agreement to repurchase <span class=""xn-money"">$50 million</span> of the Company's common stock during the fourth quarter of 2021. <b><i><u>Capital Management</u></i></b> At September&nbsp;30, 2021, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for the Company's traditional U.S. insurance companies was approximately 380 percent, and cash and marketable securities in the holding companies equaled <span class=""xn-money"">$1,638.0 million</span>. <b><i><u>Book Value</u></i></b> Book value per common share as of September&nbsp;30, 2021 was <span class=""xn-money"">$54.39</span>, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$53.50</span> at September&nbsp;30, 2020. <b><i><u>Outlook</u></i></b><b>&nbsp;</b> The volatility of the global pandemic and subsequent impacts to our business make fourth quarter estimates challenging.&nbsp; As a result, Unum will not provide an outlook for the remainder of 2021 and intends to provide a financial outlook for 2022 during the first quarter of next year. <b><u>NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES</u></b> We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures.&nbsp; A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.&nbsp; The non-GAAP financial measure of ""after-tax adjusted operating income"" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and the amortization of the cost of reinsurance as well as certain other items as specified in the reconciliations in the Financial Highlights section below.&nbsp; We believe after-tax adjusted operating income is a better performance measure and better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business. Realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments.&nbsp; Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses.&nbsp; Although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels,&nbsp;a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities. We have exited a substantial portion of our Closed Block individual disability product line through the two phases of the reinsurance transaction that were executed in <span class=""xn-chron"">December 2020</span> and <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2021</span>, respectively. As a result, we exclude the amortization of the cost of reinsurance that was recognized upon the exit of the business related to the ceded reserves for the cohort of policies on claim status. We believe that the exclusion of the amortization of the cost of reinsurance provides a better view of our results from our ongoing businesses. We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability. <b><u>CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION </u></b> Members of Unum Group senior management will host a conference call on Wednesday, November&nbsp;3, at <span class=""xn-chron"">8:00 a.m. (Eastern Time)</span> to discuss the results of operations for the third quarter.&nbsp; Topics may include forward-looking information, such as the Company's outlook on future results, trends in operations, and other material information.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b>The dial-in number for the conference call is 1-844-200-6205 for callers in the U.S. (access code 319239).&nbsp; For all other callers, the dial-in number is 1-929-526-1599 (access code 319239</b>)<b>.</b>&nbsp; A live webcast of the call will also be available at <a href=""http://www.investors.unum.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.investors.unum.com</a> in a listen-only mode.&nbsp; It is recommended that webcast viewers access the ""Investors"" section of the Company's website and opt-in to the webcast approximately 10 minutes prior to the start of the call.&nbsp; A replay of the webcast will be available on the Company's website, and will be available through Wednesday, November&nbsp;10 by dialing 1-866-813-9403 (U.S.), 0204-525-0658 (U.K.), or +44-204-525-0658 (All Other Locations) - pass code 764052.

Financial Measures</b> EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share as presented herein are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> (""GAAP""). They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that these measures provide investors additional meaningful methods to evaluate certain aspects of the company's results period over period and for the other reasons set forth below. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus interest expense net of interest income, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for the items of income and expense and expected incremental revenue and cost savings as described in our senior secured credit agreement covenant calculations. Management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about one of the principal measures of performance used by our creditors. In addition, management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our performance.  Depreciation expense for property and equipment and amortization expense of capitalized internally developed software costs relate to ongoing capital expenditures; however, amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets, such as customer relationships, software, tradenames and noncompete agreements are not representative of ongoing capital expenditures, but have a continuing effect on our reported results. Non-GAAP financial measures of operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share, in the opinion of the company, provide comparability of the company's performance to other companies that may not have incurred these types of non-cash expenses or that report a similar measure. In addition, operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share may include adjustments for certain other charges.  EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, operating adjusted net income and operating adjusted net income per share have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results as reported under GAAP.

 Revenue of $205 million generated during the third quarter of 2021, up 27% sequentially from the second quarter of 2021 As previously announced, closed on the acquisition of Complete Energy Services, Inc. (""Complete""), the water solutions subsidiary of Superior Energy Services, Inc. (""Superior""), and UltRecovery Corporation (""UltRecovery""), a provider of sustainable production enhancement applications focused on existing conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells As previously announced, subsequent to the end of third quarter, closed on the acquisition of Agua Libre Midstream, LLC (""Agua Libre"") and other water-related assets from Basic Energy Services, Inc. (""Basic"") Recently awarded three year take-or-pay contract for produced water recycling facility in the Rockies for a major integrated oil and gas company, set to be completed during the first quarter of 2022 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:15 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">HOUSTON</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Select Energy Services, Inc. (NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/select-energy-services-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results-and-operational-updates-301414590.html#financial-modal"">WTTR</a>) (""Select"" or the ""Company""), a leading provider of sustainable water and chemical solutions to the U.S. unconventional oil and gas industry, today announced results for the quarter ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>.  Revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was <span class=""xn-money"">$204.6 million</span> as compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$161.1 million</span> in the second quarter of 2021 and <span class=""xn-money"">$101.2 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020. Net loss for the third quarter of 2021 was <span class=""xn-money"">$14.2 million</span> as compared to a net loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$19.6 million</span> in the second quarter of 2021 and a net loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$36.3 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020.  <span class=""xn-person"">John Schmitz</span>, Chairman of the Board, President and CEO, stated, ""During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our strategy of improving and bolstering our base business, advancing our technology, ESG and diversification efforts, and executing on strategic M&amp;A. We generated meaningful revenue growth in the business during the third quarter, with 27% consolidated sequential revenue growth. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA doubled quarter over quarter to <span class=""xn-money"">$15.1 million</span>, supported by both our base business and the Complete acquisition. Setting aside the growth contributions of our recent M&amp;A activity, our base business grew revenue sequentially by 9%, generating incremental margins of more than 30% during the third quarter. This continued growth was driven by a combination of modest activity increases and, more importantly, continued pricing improvements. Additionally, we saw good momentum throughout the quarter, with September representing our strongest month of the year to date. With the current commodity price backdrop, we are confident in our ability to continue to grow the base business, meaningfully improve our pricing and capture market share heading into 2022. ""Looking beyond the macro-driven tailwinds towards additional ways we can support our business, we continue to make investments to support our technology, ESG initiatives and diversification efforts. Continued investment in our automation, data analytics, emissions reduction and FluidMatch™ solutions will be critical to providing our customers with lower costs and improved performance. To that end, I'm pleased to announce the addition of <span class=""xn-person"">Suzi Colbert</span> to our leadership team as Select's Chief Technology Officer. Suzi brings over 20 years of experience in a number of technology and financial operations leadership positions at Marathon, BP, Noble Corporation and Anadarko. Suzi will oversee the integration and development of our R&amp;D, operational technology and IT efforts across the organization to ensure that we continue to advance and grow our position as a technology leader in the sector. ""I am also excited about the execution on our infrastructure and recycling strategies during the third quarter. We completed the expansion of our largest recycling facility, located in <span class=""xn-location"">Martin County, Texas</span>, during the third quarter, and completed construction of our three newest Permian Basin recycling facilities in late September. Additionally, Select was recently awarded a three year take-or-pay contract to build, own and operate a produced water recycling facility for a major integrated oil and gas company in the Rockies region. These recycling opportunities will be critical to achieving our ESG goals and those of our customers by facilitating both decreased fresh water usage and reduced waste disposal. ""On the M&amp;A front, we have continued to be quite active in the marketplace with the recent acquisitions of Complete, Agua Libre and UltRecovery. Complete has already made notable contributions to our business and financial results, while we believe Agua Libre, which closed on <span class=""xn-chron"">October 1</span><sup>st</sup>, should add an incremental $70–80 million of current run-rate annualized revenue and <span class=""xn-money"">$6</span>-8 million of current run-rate annualized Adjusted EBITDA, with meaningful room for operational improvements, development and growth. ""Operationally, with Agua Libre we've acquired a solid production services presence in <span class=""xn-location"">Texas</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">New Mexico</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Oklahoma</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">North Dakota</span>, as well as more than 550,000 barrels per day of permitted disposal capacity. When combined with our existing assets, including Complete, our company-wide permitted daily disposal capacity has increased to approximately two million barrels per day. Additionally, more than half of Agua Libre's current produced water volumes are delivered via pipelines, supported by a number of long-term contracts. Ultimately, we believe these assets are well-positioned for subsequent sustainable development opportunities such as recycling and reuse solutions. Importantly, with nearly 100% of Agua Libre's revenue coming from production-related services and infrastructure, we have continued to add further revenue stability to our base business. Combined, the Complete and Agua Libre transactions have increased our production-related revenue from approximately 10% of our total revenue during the first half of 2021 to approximately 25% on a pro forma basis.""  ""Ultimately, I am excited about our recent M&amp;A execution, our technology strategy, our recycling projects and our other sustainability-focused investments. I firmly believe the market needs continued consolidation and we are well positioned to execute on additional opportunities ahead. With growing activity, strong commodity prices and improved operational and financial performance, the future remains bright,"" concluded Schmitz. <b>Consolidated Financial Information</b> For the third quarter of 2021, revenue was <span class=""xn-money"">$204.6 million</span>, net loss was <span class=""xn-money"">$14.2 million</span> and gross profit was <span class=""xn-money"">$9.0 million</span>, as compared to a gross loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.6 million</span> in the second quarter of 2021 and a gross loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$16.9 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020. Total gross margin was 4.4% in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to (1.0)% in the second quarter of 2021 and (16.7)% in the third quarter of 2020. Gross margin before depreciation and amortization (""D&amp;A"") for the third quarter of 2021 was 15.6% as compared to 12.0% for the second quarter of 2021 and 6.9% for the third quarter of 2020.  SG&amp;A during the third quarter of 2021 was <span class=""xn-money"">$22.0 million</span> as compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$15.9 million</span> during the second quarter of 2021 and <span class=""xn-money"">$16.0 million</span> during the third quarter of 2020. SG&amp;A during the third quarter of 2021 was impacted by non-recurring transaction costs, of which approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$2.4 million</span> related to SG&amp;A, &nbsp;and a <span class=""xn-money"">$2.4 million</span> increase related to incremental overhead costs added from the Complete acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was <span class=""xn-money"">$15.1 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$7.6 million</span> in the second quarter of 2021 and <span class=""xn-money"">($4.7) million</span> in the third quarter of 2020.&nbsp; Select's consolidated Adjusted EBITDA during the third quarter of 2021 includes <span class=""xn-money"">$5.5 million</span> of non-recurring or non-cash adjustments, including <span class=""xn-money"">$2.7 million</span> of non-recurring transaction costs, <span class=""xn-money"">$0.2 million</span> of non-cash losses on asset sales, <span class=""xn-money"">$0.2 million</span> in lease abandonment costs, and <span class=""xn-money"">$0.1 million</span> in other adjustments. Non-cash compensation expense accounted for an additional <span class=""xn-money"">$2.3 million</span> adjustment. Please refer to the end of this release for reconciliations of gross profit (loss) before D&amp;A (non-GAAP measure) to gross profit (loss) and of Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP measure) to net income (loss). <b>Business Segment Information </b> The <b><i>Water Services</i></b> segment generated revenues of <span class=""xn-money"">$112.5 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$76.7 million</span> in the second quarter of 2021 and <span class=""xn-money"">$54.5 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020.&nbsp; Gross margin before D&amp;A for Water Services was 15.8% in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to 7.7% in the second quarter of 2021 and 3.0% in the third quarter of 2020. Revenues improved 46.7% sequentially, driven primarily by incremental contributions from the Complete acquisition, though the legacy Select base business had strong revenue growth of approximately 11% as well. Additionally, the segment experienced very strong margin expansion, with margins more than doubling, driven by 54% incremental margins in the base business. Looking at the fourth quarter, the Company expects to see low double-digit to mid-teen percentage revenue growth with modest improvements to gross margins before D&amp;A , supported by continued pricing improvements and incremental contributions from the production services operations recently acquired from Basic. The <b><i>Water Infrastructure</i></b> segment generated revenues of <span class=""xn-money"">$36.8 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$33.3 million</span> in the second quarter of 2021 and <span class=""xn-money"">$16.2 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020. Gross margin before D&amp;A for Water Infrastructure was 22.5% in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to 21.3% in the second quarter of 2021 and 20.7% in the third quarter of 2020.&nbsp; Revenues improved 10.4% sequentially while capturing 35% incremental margins, driven primarily by contributions from the Complete acquisition and the Permian pipelines. The previously anticipated recovery in Bakken pipeline activity has largely pushed into early 2022 with modifications to customer schedules. For the fourth quarter, the Company anticipates the combination of contributions from Agua Libre and the recently completed recycling projects will result in high single-digit to low double-digit percentage revenue growth, with gross margins before D&amp;A in the low- to mid-20 percent range. &nbsp; The <b><i>Oilfield Chemicals</i></b> segment generated revenues of <span class=""xn-money"">$55.4 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$51.1 million</span> in the second quarter of 2021 and <span class=""xn-money"">$30.6 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020.&nbsp; Gross margin before D&amp;A for Oilfield Chemicals was 10.5% in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to 12.5% in the second quarter of 2021 and 6.6% in the third quarter of 2020. Revenues improved 8.3% sequentially, though margins were impacted by continued raw materials pricing challenges as well as costs associated with the reactivation of the Tyler facility. The Company anticipates low- to mid-teen percentage sequential revenue growth in this segment during the fourth quarter. With supply chain disruptions beginning to normalize and the Tyler facility back up and running, gross margins before D&amp;A are expected to improve back towards the levels seen during the second quarter of 2021.  <b>Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures</b> Cash flow from operations for the third quarter of 2021 was <span class=""xn-money"">($2.5) million</span> as compared to <span class=""xn-money"">($7.6) million</span> in the second quarter of 2021 and <span class=""xn-money"">$17.1 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020. Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2021 were <span class=""xn-money"">$15.1 million</span>, net of ordinary course asset sales during the quarter of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.4 million</span>. Cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, net of asset sales, was <span class=""xn-money"">($17.6) million</span> during the third quarter of 2021. Additionally, cash flow used in investing activities included approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$14.2 million</span> for the Company's acquisition of Complete, <span class=""xn-money"">$2.5 million</span> for the Company's acquisition of UltRecovery, and <span class=""xn-money"">$2.0 million</span> for the escrow deposit required by the stalking horse asset purchase agreement relating to the acquisition of Agua Libre and other water-related assets from Basic. <b>Balance Sheet and Capital Structure</b> Total cash and cash equivalents were <span class=""xn-money"">$107.4 million</span> as of <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> as compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$169.0 million</span> as of <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2020</span>.

The Company had available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility as of <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> and <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2020</span>, of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$124.8 million</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$80.8 million</span>, respectively, after giving effect to <span class=""xn-money"">$15.6 million</span> of outstanding letters of credit as of both <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> and <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2020</span>.

The Company had 88,596,736 weighted average Class A shares outstanding and 16,221,101 weighted average Class B shares outstanding during the third quarter of 2021. <b>Complete Energy Services Acquisition</b> On <span class=""xn-chron"">July 9, 2021</span>, Select closed on the acquisition of Complete, an operating subsidiary of Superior.

<span class=""prnews_span"">EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit before depreciation and amortization (D&amp;A) and gross margin before D&amp;A are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus/(minus) loss/(income) from discontinued operations, plus any impairment charges or asset write-offs pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""GAAP""), plus non-cash losses on the sale of assets or subsidiaries, non-recurring compensation expense, non-cash compensation expense, and non-recurring or unusual expenses or charges, including severance expenses, transaction costs, or facilities-related exit and disposal-related expenditures, plus/(minus) foreign currency losses/(gains) and plus/(minus) losses/(gains) on unconsolidated entities. We define gross profit before D&amp;A as revenue less cost of revenue, excluding cost of sales D&amp;A expense. We define gross margin before D&amp;A as gross profit before D&amp;A divided by revenue. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit before D&amp;A and gross margin before D&amp;A are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and non-recurring items outside the control of our management team. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit before D&amp;A and gross margin before D&amp;A because we believe they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP. </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Gross profit (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to gross profit before D&amp;A. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool due to exclusion of some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or gross profit before D&amp;A in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and gross profit before D&amp;A may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.

Earthstone estimates the acquired assets to have <span class=""xn-money"">$116.0 million</span> of PDP PV-10 as of <span class=""xn-chron"">July 1, 2021</span>, with associated reserves of approximately 13.3 MMBoe (11% oil, 31% NGL, 58% natural gas) <sup>(1)</sup> based on NYMEX strip pricing as of <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30</span>, 2021.&nbsp; The low-decline, high-margin producing assets acquired in the Foreland Acquisition are expected to add approximately 4,000 Boepd (17% oil, 47% liquids) to Earthstone's daily production from the closing date through year-end 2021.  <b><u>Management Comments</u></b> Mr. <span class=""xn-person"">Robert J. Anderson</span>, President and CEO of Earthstone, commented, ""We are pleased to have closed the Foreland Acquisition, which is our fourth acquisition this year, as we continue our efforts to advance our consolidation strategy, having approximately doubled our daily production rate this year. &nbsp;The acquisition of these producing assets at an attractive valuation in a rising commodity price environment is a nice addition to our production and cash flow base.&nbsp; We expect to create value from operational synergies with our nearby existing assets and look forward to applying our operating approach in order to reduce costs and maximize production and cash flows."" <b><u>About Earthstone Energy, Inc.</u></b> Earthstone Energy, Inc. is a growth-oriented, independent energy company engaged in the acquisition, development and operation of oil and natural gas properties.

The forward-looking statements include statements about the expected benefits of the Foreland Acquisition to Earthstone and its stockholders. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and analyses made by Earthstone and its management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate under the circumstances.

As a result of acquisition accounting (purchase accounting or PGAAP), financial results for periods after <span class=""xn-chron"">June 1, 2020</span> are generally not comparable to the results of prior periods.&nbsp; Certain metrics, such as sales and policyholder account values, are not affected by PGAAP and are comparable to prior period data. <span class=""xn-person"">William P. Foley, II</span>, commented, ""For the third quarter, we grew revenues 31% to <span class=""xn-money"">$3.9 billion</span> which resulted in adjusted net earnings growth of 39% to <span class=""xn-money"">$604 million</span>, both as compared to the 2020 third quarter. Importantly, holding company cash grew by 25% to <span class=""xn-money"">$1.5 billion</span> as compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$1.2 billion</span> at the end of the 2021 second quarter. We grew cash on our balance sheet despite being active with our capital allocation program focused on share buybacks and a steady stream of capital return with our dividend. Our results speak to the dynamic business model that we have created which we believe positions FNF for success through varying market cycles. Looking at our Title results, we delivered adjusted pre-tax title earnings of <span class=""xn-money"">$669 million</span> and an adjusted pre-tax title margin of 21.7%, compared to adjusted pre-tax title earnings of <span class=""xn-money"">$528 million</span> and an adjusted pretax title margin of 21.2% in the 2020 comparable quarter. Our third quarter margins and earnings were the strongest third quarter results in our Company's history which speaks to our market leading position combined with the outstanding execution of our entire team. Total commercial revenues also continued at record levels as we achieved <span class=""xn-money"">$366 million</span> of revenues in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 69% as compared to the year ago third quarter. Commercial opened orders have exceeded 1,000 per day over the last eight months, having consistently been in record territory and will provide momentum for the fourth quarter and the beginning of 2022 given the longer tail for closings in commercial as compared to residential.  Turning to F&amp;G, we are making great strides on our diversified growth strategy. The new Institutional channel is on track to achieve <span class=""xn-money"">$3 billion</span> of first year sales in 2021 from funding agreements and pension risk transfer transactions.&nbsp; In addition, total retail sales at <span class=""xn-money"">$1.6 billion</span> in the quarter grew by 44%, as compared to the third quarter of 2020, and reflect productive and expanding relationships with bank, broker dealer and agent distribution partners. F&amp;G continues to maintain attractive spreads, and this disciplined approach to attracting new business has resulted in strong adjusted net earnings that contributed 17% of FNF's consolidated results in the third quarter. Mr. Foley concluded, ""Our capital allocation strategy remains a key focus of the Board. Our disciplined strategy is focused on returning capital to shareholders, while making strategic investments in our businesses to drive profitable growth and attractive returns for our shareholders. We recently announced our fourth quarter dividend of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.44</span> per share, an increase of 10% from our previous quarterly dividend,&nbsp;and have continued to make share repurchases throughout the third quarter and into the fourth as we completed our previously announced <span class=""xn-money"">$500 million</span> share repurchase plan in the first week of October. During the quarter we purchased 1.3 million shares at an average purchase price of <span class=""xn-money"">$46.29</span> per share.""  <b><u>Conference Call <br class=""dnr""></u></b>We will host a call with investors and analysts to discuss third quarter 2021 FNF results on&nbsp;Wednesday, November 3, 2021, beginning at <span class=""xn-chron"">12:00 p.m. Eastern Time</span>.&nbsp; A live webcast of the conference call will be available on the Events and Multimedia page of the FNF Investor Relations website at <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3343256-1&amp;h=1277914403&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ffnf.com%2F&amp;a=fnf.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fnf.com</a>.&nbsp; The conference call replay will be available via webcast through the FNF Investor Relations website at <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3343256-1&amp;h=1277914403&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ffnf.com%2F&amp;a=fnf.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fnf.com</a>.

GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, FNF has provided non-GAAP financial measures, which it believes are useful to help investors better understand its financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pre-tax title earnings, adjusted pre-tax title earnings as a percentage of adjusted title revenue (adjusted pre-tax title margin), F&amp;G adjusted net earnings, F&amp;G adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders, F&amp;G net investment spread, F&amp;G average assets under management and F&amp;G sales. Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP net earnings. Further, FNF's non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures are provided below. <b><u>Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors <br class=""dnr""></u></b>This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

Adjusted net earnings is calculated by adjusting net earnings (loss) from continuing operations to eliminate:  (i) Recognized (gains) and losses, net: the impact of net investment gains/losses, including changes in allowance for expected credit losses and other than temporary impairment (""OTTI"") losses, recognized in operations; the impact of market volatility on the alternative asset portfolio; and the effect of changes in fair value of the reinsurance related embedded derivative;  (ii) Indexed product related derivatives: the impacts related to changes in the fair value, including both realized and unrealized gains and losses, of index product related derivatives and embedded derivatives, net of hedging cost;&nbsp;  (iii) Purchase price amortization: the impacts related to the amortization of certain intangibles (internally developed software, trademarks and value of distribution asset (VODA)) recognized as a result of acquisition activities;&nbsp;  (iv) Transaction costs: the impacts related to acquisition, integration and merger related items, and  (v) Other ""non-recurring"", ""infrequent"" or ""unusual items"":&nbsp; Management excludes certain items determined to be ""non-recurring"", ""infrequent"" or ""unusual"" from adjusted net earnings when incurred if it is determined these expenses are not a reflection of the core business and when the nature of the item is such that it is not reasonably likely to recur within two years and/or there was not a similar item in the preceding two years. Adjustments to Adjusted net earnings are net of the corresponding impact on amortization of intangibles, as appropriate. The income tax impact related to these adjustments is measured using an effective tax rate, as appropriate by tax jurisdiction. While these adjustments are an integral part of the overall performance of F&amp;G, market conditions and/or the non-operating nature of these items can overshadow the underlying performance of the core business. Accordingly, management considers this to be a useful measure internally and to investors and analysts in analyzing the trends of our operations.&nbsp;  <b><i>Adjusted Net Earnings Attributable to Common Shareholders </i></b> Adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders is a non-GAAP economic measure we use to evaluate financial performance attributable to our common shareholders each period. Adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders is calculated by adjusting net earnings (loss) available to common shareholders to eliminate the same items as described in the Adjusted net earnings paragraph above. While these adjustments are an integral part of the overall performance of the Company, market conditions and/or the non-operating nature of these items can overshadow the underlying performance of the core business.&nbsp; Accordingly, Management considers this to be a useful measure internally and to investors and analysts in analyzing the trends of our operations.&nbsp;  <b><i>Net Investment Spread </i></b> Net investment spread is the excess of net investment income, adjusted for market volatility on the alternative asset investment portfolio, earned over the sum of interest credited to policyholders and the cost of hedging our risk on indexed product policies.&nbsp; Management considers this non-GAAP financial measure to be useful internally and to investors and analysts when assessing the performance of the Company's invested assets against the level of investment return provided to policyholders, inclusive of hedging costs.  <b><i>Average Assets Under Management (AAUM) </i></b> AAUM is calculated as the sum of:&nbsp;  (i) total invested assets at amortized cost, excluding derivatives;&nbsp;  (ii) related party loans and investments;  (iii) accrued investment income;  (iv) funds withheld at fair value;&nbsp;  (v) the net payable/receivable for the purchase/sale of investments, and  (iv) cash and cash equivalents, excluding derivative collateral, at the beginning of the period and the end of each month in the period, divided by the total number of months in the period plus one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Management considers this non-GAAP financial measure to be useful internally and to investors and analysts when assessing the rate of return on assets available for reinvestment. <b><i>Sales (FIA Sales and Total Retail Annuity Sales)&nbsp; </i></b> Sales are not derived from any specific GAAP income statement accounts or line items and should not be viewed as a substitute for any financial measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Annuity and IUL sales are recorded as deposit liabilities (i.e. contractholder funds) within the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP.&nbsp; Management believes that presentation of sales, as measured for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our business and helps depict longer term trends that may not be apparent in the results of operations due to the timing of sales and revenue recognition.

Volumes were slightly lower as raw material shortages had a dampening effect on growth in some categories.

This was partly offset by lower cheese, coffee and home and personal care volumes.  In <span class=""xn-location"">Europe</span>, volumes were lower than in the same period last year with higher volumes in pet food, medical, premium coffee and confectionary end markets offset by lower film and foil rollstock, snack food and pharmaceutical volumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Volumes continued to grow at mid single digit rates across the Asian emerging markets, with double digit growth in both <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">India</span>, partly offset by lower volumes in <span class=""xn-location"">South East Asia</span>. Volumes in <span class=""xn-location"">Latin America</span> were also lower than the prior period.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Adjusted EBIT of <span class=""xn-money"">$339 million</span> was 8% higher than in the prior period on a comparable constant currency basis reflecting favorable mix and strong cost performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The business maintained adjusted EBIT margins at 12.9% despite the time lag between the impact of higher raw material costs and related pricing actions. <span class=""prnews_span""><b><i>Rigid Packaging</i></b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Comparable <br class=""dnr"">constant currency <br class=""dnr"">∆%</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Three Months Ended September 30, </b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Reported ∆%</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Adjusted non-GAAP results</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020 $ <br class=""dnr"">million</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021 $ <br class=""dnr"">million</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Net sales<sup>(1)</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">698</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">786</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">13</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Adjusted EBIT</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">72</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">62</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(14)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(15)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Adjusted EBIT / Sales %</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">10.3</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">7.9</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(1) Comparable constant currency ∆% for Net sales excludes an 11% favorable impact from the pass through of raw material costs and a 1% favorable currency impact.</span> Net sales for the Rigid Packaging segment grew by 13% on a reported basis, with 11% driven by price increases of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$75 million</span> related to the pass through of higher raw material costs.&nbsp;  On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were 1% higher than the prior period.&nbsp; Overall volumes were 1% higher than the prior period and price/mix had no material impact on net sales. In <span class=""xn-location"">North America</span>, beverage volumes were marginally ahead of the prior year with hot fill container volumes down 1% against a strong comparative period.&nbsp; Specialty container volumes were lower than the prior year which benefited from strong volumes in the home and personal care category.  In <span class=""xn-location"">Latin America</span>, volumes grew at double digit rates with higher volumes in <span class=""xn-location"">Argentina</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Brazil</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Colombia</span>.  Adjusted EBIT of <span class=""xn-money"">$62 million</span> was adversely impacted by unprecedented industry wide supply chain complexity and disruptions in North America.&nbsp; Demand remained elevated and increasingly volatile in the beverage segment while the business continued to operate at full capacity and with historically low levels of inventory. Combined with further inflation and shortages for key raw materials, the business experienced operating inefficiencies, higher costs and constrained sales. This was partly offset by higher earnings in <span class=""xn-location"">Latin America</span>. We anticipate the industry wide supply chain challenges currently experienced in <span class=""xn-location"">North America</span> will improve through the second half of fiscal 2022.  <span class=""prnews_span""><b><i>Other</i></b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Three Months Ended September 30, </b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Adjusted EBIT</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020 $ million</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021 $ million</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">AMVIG (equity accounted investment, net of tax)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">3</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">—</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Corporate expenses</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(30)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(20)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Total Other</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(27)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(20)</span> <b>Net interest and income tax expense</b> Net interest expense for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> was <span class=""xn-money"">$35 million</span> and was in line with the same period last year.&nbsp; Tax expense for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> (excluding amounts related to non-GAAP adjustments) was <span class=""xn-money"">$73 million</span> and was in line with the same period last year.&nbsp; Adjusted tax expense represents an effective tax rate of 21.2% in the current period (22.3% in the same period last year). <b>Free Cash Flow</b> Adjusted free cash outflow was <span class=""xn-money"">$242 million</span> and compares with an outflow of <span class=""xn-money"">$190 million</span> last year.&nbsp; The higher use of cash was mainly driven by the timing impact of higher raw material costs on working capital.&nbsp;  Net debt was <span class=""xn-money"">$5,959 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30</span>, 2021.&nbsp; Leverage, measured as net debt divided by adjusted trailing twelve month EBITDA, was 2.9 times, in line with Amcor's expectations given the seasonality of cash flows.  <b>Fiscal 2022 guidance</b> Consistent with guidance provided in <span class=""xn-chron"">August 2021</span>, for the twelve month period ending <span class=""xn-chron"">June 30, 2022</span>, the Company expects: Amcor's guidance contemplates a range of factors which create a higher degree of uncertainty and additional complexity when estimating future financial results.&nbsp; Further information can be found under 'Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements' in this release. <b>Conference Call</b> Amcor is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss these results on <span class=""xn-chron"">Tuesday November 2, 2021</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">5:30pm</span> US Eastern Daylight Time / <span class=""xn-chron"">Wednesday November 3, 2021</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">8:30am</span> Australian Eastern Daylight Time.

While not all inclusive, examples of these items include: Amcor also evaluates performance on a comparable constant currency basis, which measures financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the average rates in effect for the comparable prior year period. In order to compute comparable constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, current-year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We then adjust for other items affecting comparability.&nbsp; While not all inclusive, examples of items affecting comparability include the difference between sales or earnings in the current period and the prior period related to acquired, disposed, or ceased operations.&nbsp; Comparable constant currency net sales performance also excludes the impact from passing through movements in raw material costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Management has used and uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performance of the Company's reporting segments and certain of the measures are used as a component of Amcor's board of directors' measurement of Amcor's performance for incentive compensation purposes. Amcor believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure has been provided herein. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.&nbsp; The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome and timing of certain significant forward-looking items without unreasonable effort.&nbsp; These items include but are not limited to the impact of foreign exchange translation, restructuring program costs, asset impairments, possible gains and losses on the sale of assets, and certain tax related events.&nbsp; These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP earnings and cash flow measures for the guidance period. <b>Dividends</b> Amcor has received a waiver from the ASX's settlement operating rules, which will allow the Company to defer processing conversions between its ordinary share and CDI registers from <span class=""xn-chron"">November 23, 2021</span> to <span

(NYSE: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/castlight-health-announces-third-quarter-2021-results-301414448.html#financial-modal"">CSLT</a>), a leading health navigation platform provider, today announced results for its third quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2021.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results has been provided in this press release in the accompanying tables. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures."" <b>Business Outlook</b> For the full year 2021, the Company expects: For the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company expects:  <b>Quarterly Conference Call</b> Castlight Health senior management will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter 2021 results and business outlook today at <span class=""xn-chron"">2:00 p.m. Pacific Time</span> (<span class=""xn-chron"">5:00 p.m. Eastern Time</span>).

Follow us on <u>Twitter</u> and <u>LinkedIn</u> and Like us on <u>Facebook</u>. <b>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b> To supplement Castlight Health's financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we also use and provide investors and others with non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance, including non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share. Non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) exclude goodwill impairment, stock-based compensation, certain legal expenses, amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, capitalization and amortization of internal-use software, and lease exit and related charges. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors and others, facilitate the analysis of the company's core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods, and can help enhance overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures we provide may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Castlight Health encourages investors and others to review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. We have provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, except that we have not reconciled our non-GAAP operating loss and net loss per share guidance for the full year 2021 to comparable GAAP measures because we do not provide guidance for stock-based compensation expense, and capitalization and amortization of internal-use software, which are reconciling items between GAAP and non-GAAP. The factors that may impact our future stock-based compensation expense, and capitalization and amortization of internal-use software, are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and therefore we are unable to provide such guidance without unreasonable effort. Factors include our market capitalization and related volatility of our stock price and our inability to project the cost or scope of internally produced software. <b>Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements</b> This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

Excluding these premium refunds and credits, net premiums earned and net premiums written increased 2.2%&nbsp;and 5.2%, respectively, for the three&nbsp;months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021 from the corresponding period in 2020, and 0.8% and 2.8%, respectively, for the nine&nbsp;months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021 from the corresponding period in 2020.</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b><sup>(3)</sup></b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Net realized investment (losses) gains before tax were $(44) million and $64 million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $57 million and $(28) million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The changes in fair value of the Company's investments are recorded as part of net realized investment gains or losses in its consolidated statements of operations due to the adoption of the fair value option for its investments as permitted under GAAP. </span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b><sup>(4)</sup></b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Catastrophe losses due to the events that occurred during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021 totaled approximately $91 million, with no reinsurance benefits used for these losses, resulting primarily from the deep freeze and other extreme weather events in Texas and Oklahoma, wildfires and winter storms in California, and the impact of Hurricane Ida in New Jersey and New York. These losses were partially offset by favorable development of approximately $6 million on prior years' catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses due to the events that occurred during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2020 totaled approximately $48 million, with no reinsurance benefits used for these losses, resulting primarily from wildfires and windstorms in California and extreme weather events outside of California. These losses were partially offset by favorable development of approximately $5 million on prior years' catastrophe losses. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b><sup>(5)</sup></b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">The Company experienced favorable development of approximately $8 million and $2 million on prior accident years' loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and favorable development of approximately $24 million and unfavorable development of approximately $26 million on prior accident years' loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The year-to-date favorable development in 2021 was primarily attributable to lower than estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses in the private passenger automobile and homeowners lines of insurance business, partially offset by unfavorable development in the commercial automobile line of insurance business. The year-to-date unfavorable development in 2020 was primarily attributable to higher than estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses in the homeowners and commercial automobile lines of insurance business, partially offset by favorable development in the California private passenger automobile line of insurance business.</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b><u>Investment Results</u></b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Three Months Ended September 30,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Nine Months Ended September 30,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>(000</i><i>'</i><i>s except average annual yield)</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Average invested assets at cost <sup>(1)</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">4,751,171</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">4,328,804</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">4,643,916</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">4,256,759</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Net investment income <sup>(2)</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before income taxes</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">32,334</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">32,140</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">95,566</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">100,801</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After income taxes</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">28,708</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">28,789</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">85,168</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">89,757</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Average annual yield on investments - after income taxes<sup> (2)</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">2.4</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">2.7</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">2.5</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">2.8</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><sup>(1)</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Fixed maturities and short-term bonds at amortized cost; equities and other short-term investments at cost.

Average annual yield on investments after income taxes for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021 decreased compared to the corresponding periods in 2020, primarily due to the maturity and replacement of higher yielding investments purchased when market interest rates were higher with lower yielding investments, as a result of decreasing market interest rates. </span> The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.6350</span> per share.

</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(b)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Federal statutory rate of 21%.</span> <b>Information Regarding GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures</b> The Company has presented information within this document containing operating measures which in management's opinion provide investors with useful, industry specific information to help them evaluate, and perform meaningful comparisons of, the Company's performance, but that may not be presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are not intended to replace, and should be read in conjunction with, the GAAP financial results. <b>Net income </b>is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income. <b>Operating income</b> is net income excluding realized investment gains and losses, net of tax. Operating income is used by management along with the other components of net income to assess the Company's performance. Management uses operating income as an important measure to evaluate the results of the Company's insurance business. Management believes that operating income provides investors with a valuable measure of the Company's ongoing performance as it reveals trends in the Company's insurance business that may be obscured by the effect of net realized investment gains and losses. Realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments such as capital market conditions. Accordingly, operating income highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the Company's core insurance business. Operating income, which is provided as supplemental information and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, does not reflect the overall profitability of the Company's business. It should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. See ""Supplemental Schedules"" above for a reconciliation of net income to operating income. <b>Net premiums earned</b>, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to net premiums written, represents the portion of premiums written that is recognized as revenue in the financial statements for the periods presented and earned on a pro-rata basis over the term of the policies. <b>Net premiums written</b> is a statutory financial measure which represents the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any applicable reinsurance.&nbsp; Net premiums written is designed to determine production levels and is meant as supplemental information and not intended to replace net premiums earned. Such information should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. See ""Supplemental Schedules"" above for a reconciliation of net premiums earned to net premiums written. <b>Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses</b>&nbsp;is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to&nbsp;paid losses and loss adjustment expenses.<b> Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses</b> excludes the effects of changes in the loss reserve accounts. Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses is provided as supplemental information and is not intended to replace incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. It should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. See ""Supplemental Schedules"" above for a reconciliation of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses to paid losses and loss adjustment expenses. <b>Combined ratio</b>&nbsp;is the most directly comparable measure to combined ratio-accident period basis. <b>Combined ratio-accident period basis </b>is computed as the difference between two GAAP operating ratios: the combined ratio and prior accident periods'&nbsp;loss development ratio. Management believes that combined ratio-accident period basis is useful to investors and it is used to reveal the trends in the Company's results of operations that may be obscured by development on prior accident periods'&nbsp;loss reserves. Combined ratio-accident period basis is meant as supplemental information and is not intended to replace the GAAP combined ratio. It should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial results. See ""Supplemental Schedules"" above for a reconciliation of GAAP combined ratio to combined ratio-accident period basis.&nbsp;  SOURCE Mercury General Corporation  <a title=""Link to http://www.mercuryinsurance.com"" href=""http://www.mercuryinsurance.com/"" class=""linkOnClick"" data-include="""" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.mercuryinsurance.com</a><br> More news releases in similar topics <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>

Concurrently with the closing of the Offering and the issuance of the Notes, Summit Holdings, as borrower, entered into a first-lien, senior secured credit agreement with the Partnership, certain subsidiaries of the Partnership party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as agent and the several lenders and other agents party thereto, consisting of a <span class=""xn-money"">$400.0 million</span> asset-based revolving credit facility (the ""ABL Credit Agreement""). The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed, on a senior second-priority secured basis, by the Partnership and each restricted subsidiary of the Partnership (other than the Co-Issuers) that is an obligor under the ABL Credit Agreement or under the Co-Issuers' 5.75% Senior Notes due 2025 (the ""2025 Notes""). The Obligations under and as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed, on a senior first-priority secured basis, by the Partnership and certain subsidiaries of Summit Holdings.

The indenture governing the 2022 Notes was satisfied and discharged upon the closing of the Offering.

An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Operating Measures."" <b>Third Quarter 2021 and Recent Business Highlights</b> <b>Financial Outlook </b> We provide the financial guidance below based on current market conditions and expectations. Our guidance is subject to various important cautionary factors described below. Based on information available as of November&nbsp;2, 2021, guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021 and full year 2021 is as follows: The financial outlook above for non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share excludes estimates for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related adjustments, and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis primarily because of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related adjustments, and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. In particular, stock-based compensation expense is impacted by our future hiring and retention needs, as well as the future fair market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, all of which is not within our control, is difficult to predict, and is subject to constant change. The actual amount of these expenses during 2021 will have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial guidance measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. <sup>1 </sup>Gartner Peer Insights, ""Voice of the Customer: Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms"", 2021*. <b>*Gartner Disclaimer: <br class=""dnr""></b>Gartner Peer Insights Customers' Choice constitute the subjective opinions of individual end-user reviews, ratings, and data applied against a documented methodology; they neither represent the views of, nor constitute an endorsement by, Gartner or its affiliates. <b>Quarterly Conference Call </b> Alteryx will host a conference call today at <span class=""xn-chron"">5:00 p.m. Eastern Time</span> to discuss the company's financial results and financial guidance.

The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.  We use non-GAAP measures to internally evaluate and analyze financial results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and enable comparison of our financial results with other public companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. We exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP financial measures: <i>Stock-based compensation expense</i>. We exclude stock-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash expense, from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In particular, companies calculate stock-based compensation expense using a variety of valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions. <i>Acquisition-related adjustments</i>. We exclude amortization and impairment of intangible assets and changes in fair value of contingent consideration which are non-cash and related to business combinations, from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures.&nbsp;In addition, we exclude acquisition expenses, such as transaction costs and other non-recurring incremental costs incurred, as they are related to a business combination and have no direct correlation to the operation of our business. <i>Convertible senior notes adjustments</i>. We exclude the portion of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs that relate to the equity component of our convertible notes, which are non-cash, from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures. We exclude such expenses as they are non-cash and have no direct correlation to the operation of our business. <i>Income tax adjustments.</i>&nbsp;We utilize a fixed annual projected long-term non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance, excess tax benefits associated with stock options, and tax effects of acquisition-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this rate, we exclude the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based compensation expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles, and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. The projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions, and considers other factors including our expected tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where we operate. We used a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 20% for both 2021 and 2020. The non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. We will re-evaluate our long-term rate as appropriate. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, we exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs which are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. The non-GAAP measures we use may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures. <i>Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)</i>. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, represents the total annual contract value for active customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date. We also use ARR as one of our operating measures to assess the health and trajectory of our business. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be a substitute for, or combined with, any of these items.  <b>Forward-Looking Statements</b> This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2021, our ability to execute our long-term growth strategy and transformation efforts, the anticipated benefits of and innovation resulting from our acquisitions, our non-GAAP tax rate for 2021, and other future events.

<b><i>Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate</i></b>.&nbsp; Our dollar-based net expansion rate is a trailing four-quarter average of the annual contract value, or ACV, which is defined as the subscription revenue that we would contractually expect to recognize over the term of the contract divided by the term of the contract, in years, from a cohort of customers in a quarter as compared to the same quarter in the prior year. To calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate, we first identify a cohort of customers, or the Base Customers, in a particular quarter, or the Base Quarter. A customer will not be considered a Base Customer unless such customer has an active subscription on the last day of the Base Quarter. We then divide the ACV in the same quarter of the subsequent year attributable to the Base Customers, or the Comparison Quarter, including Base Customers from which we no longer derive ACV in the Comparison Quarter, by the ACV attributable to those Base Customers in the Base Quarter. Our dollar-based net expansion rate in a particular quarter is then obtained by averaging the result from that particular quarter with the corresponding result from each of the prior three quarters. The dollar-based net expansion rate excludes contract value relating to professional services from that cohort. <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Mar. 31,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Jun.&nbsp;30,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Sep.&nbsp;30,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Dec.&nbsp;31,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Mar. 31,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Jun.&nbsp;30,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Sep.&nbsp;30,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Dollar-based net expansion rate </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">128</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">126</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">124</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">122</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">120</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">120</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">119</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">%</span> <b><i>Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)</i></b>.

Since <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2016</span>, as Director of the Gastreonterology and Hepatology Division, he overlooks all the medical and scientific activities in the field of liver disease.

 Company reinforces strength of its core business and vision of building an integrated and digital real estate transaction to shop for, buy, sell, finance and close on homes News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:05 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">SEATTLE</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zillow-group-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results--shares-plan-to-wind-down-zillow-offers-operations-301414460.html#financial-modal"">Z</a> and ZG), today announced consolidated financial results for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 30, 2021</span>, and its plan to wind down Zillow Offers, the company's iBuying service in which Zillow acts as the primary purchaser and seller of homes.  ""We've determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated and continuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility,"" said Zillow Group co-founder and CEO <span class=""xn-person"">Rich Barton</span>. ""While we built and learned a tremendous amount operating Zillow Offers, it served only a small portion of our customers. Our core business and brand are strong, and we remain committed to creating an integrated and digital real estate transaction that solves the pain points of buyers and sellers while serving a wider audience."" The wind-down is expected to take several quarters and will include a reduction of Zillow's workforce by approximately 25%. ""The most difficult part of this decision is that it will impact many of our colleagues,"" Barton said. ""This is not something we take lightly. We are grateful for their efforts, and we are committed to providing a smooth transition."" The company reported the following Q3 financial results:  Included in the company's third-quarter financial results is a write-down of inventory of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$304 million</span> within the Homes segment as a result of purchasing homes in Q3 at higher prices than the company's current estimates of future selling prices. The company further expects an additional <span class=""xn-money"">$240 million</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$265 million</span> of losses to be recognized in Q4 primarily on homes it expects to purchase in Q4.

We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA in total to net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA by segment to income (loss) before income taxes for each segment, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA in total and for each segment has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA in total and for each segment alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes for each segment, and our other GAAP results. <b>About Zillow Group, Inc.</b> Zillow Group, Inc.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:05 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">ROCKVILLE, Md.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- REGENXBIO Inc. (Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/regenxbio-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results-and-operational-highlights-301414492.html#financial-modal"">RGNX</a>) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, and recent operational highlights. ""We are encouraged by the clinical profile emerging from ongoing clinical trials evaluating the suprachoroidal delivery of RGX-314 for the treatment of wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy. Preliminary data highlight the potential of one-time, in-office delivery of RGX-314 which could provide sustainable, long-term anti-VEGF protein production in the eye for patients,"" said&nbsp;Kenneth T. Mills, President and Chief Executive Officer of&nbsp;REGENXBIO. ""Moreover, our recently announced eye care collaboration with AbbVie, combining our AAV gene therapy expertise with AbbVie's global developmental and commercial infrastructure within eye care, will further support the broad potential of our RGX-314 program utilizing both subretinal and suprachoroidal delivery. We continue to expect this transaction to close by the end of this year."" Mr. Mills added: ""For the remainder of 2021, we are focused on continuing to enroll patients in the ATMOSPHERE<span>™</span>&nbsp;trial and initiating our second pivotal trial for RGX-314 using subretinal delivery, sharing additional interim data from our AAVIATE<sup>®</sup> trial and filing an IND for RGX-202 for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This year has been transformative for REGENXBIO, and I am grateful to our dedicated employees for their commitment to our mission to develop therapeutics for diseases that have significant unmet needs."" <b>Eye Care Collaboration with AbbVie</b> <b>Recent Operational Highlights</b> <b><i>Gene Therapy Using NAV Vectors for AAV-Mediated Antibody Delivery</i></b> <b><i>Gene Therapy Using NAV Vectors for Rare Genetic Diseases</i></b> <b>Operational Updates</b> <b>NAV Technology Licensee Program Highlights</b> As of <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, REGENXBIO's NAV<sup>® </sup>Technology Platform&nbsp;was being applied in one marketed product, and multiple clinical stage programs, with over 20 partnered programs in total. REGENXBIO's NAV Technology Licensees are advancing product candidates in a broad range of therapeutic areas and disease indications.  Recent updates from NAV Technology Licensees include: <b><i>Marketed NAV Technology Products</i></b> REGENXBIO's NAV Technology Platform is being applied in one marketed product, Zolgensma<sup>®</sup>. On <span class=""xn-chron"">October 26, 2021</span>, Novartis AG reported third quarter 2021 global Zolgensma sales revenue of <span class=""xn-money"">$375 million</span>.&nbsp;  <b>Financial Results</b> <i>Cash Position</i>: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were <span class=""xn-money"">$533.5 million</span> as of <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$522.5 million</span> as of <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2020</span>. The increase was primarily attributable to <span class=""xn-money"">$216.1 million</span> of aggregate net proceeds received from the Company's follow-on public offering of common stock completed in <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2021</span>, and was partially offset by net cash used in operating activities of <span class=""xn-money"">$107.4 million</span>, cash used to purchase property and equipment of <span class=""xn-money"">$69.6 million</span>, and Zolgensma royalties paid to Healthcare Royalty Management, LLC of <span class=""xn-money"">$33.3 million</span> during the nine months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>. <i>Revenues:</i>&nbsp;Revenues were <span class=""xn-money"">$30.8 million</span> for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$98.9 million</span> for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2020</span>. The decrease was primarily attributable to an $80.0 <span id=""spanHghltbbce"">million</span>&nbsp;milestone fee recognized as revenue in the third quarter of 2020 upon the achievement of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.0 billion</span> of cumulative net sales of Zolgensma, and was partially offset by an increase in Zolgensma royalty revenues, which increased by <span class=""xn-money"">$11.5 million</span>, from <span class=""xn-money"">$18.8 million</span> for the third quarter of 2020 to <span class=""xn-money"">$30.3 million</span> for the third quarter of 2021. As reported by Novartis, sales of Zolgensma for the third quarter of 2021 increased by 29% as compared to the third quarter of 2020, driven by geographic expansion of product access. <i>Research and Development Expenses</i>: Research and development expenses were <span class=""xn-money"">$47.9 million</span> for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$44.0 million</span> for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2020</span>. The increase was primarily attributable to personnel costs as a result of increased headcount, as well as laboratory and facilities costs. <i>General and Administrative Expenses</i>: General and administrative expenses were <span class=""xn-money"">$21.0 million</span> for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$15.9 million</span> for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2020</span>. The increase was primarily attributable to personnel costs as a result of increased headcount and professional fees for advisory and other services <i>Net Loss</i>: Net loss was <span class=""xn-money"">$58.4 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$1.37</span> basic and diluted net loss per share, for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, compared to net income of <span class=""xn-money"">$8.8 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.24</span> basic and <span class=""xn-money"">$0.23</span> diluted net income per share, for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2020</span>. <b>Financial Guidance</b> Based on its current operating plan, REGENXBIO expects its balance in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of <span class=""xn-money"">$533.5 million</span> as of <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> to fund its operations, including the completion of its internal manufacturing capabilities and clinical advancement of its product candidates, into the second half of 2023, excluding the effect of any potential payments that may be received under REGENXBIO's collaboration with AbbVie, which is expected to close by the end of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals.&nbsp; <b>Conference Call</b> In connection with this announcement, REGENXBIO will host a conference call and webcast today at <span class=""xn-chron"">4:30 p.m. ET</span>.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:05 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">MADISON, Wis.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;Exact Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/exact-sciences-announces-third-quarter-2021-results-301414569.html#financial-modal"">EXAS</a>) today announced that the company generated revenue of <span class=""xn-money"">$456.4 million</span> for the third quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2021, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$408.4 million</span> for the same period of 2020. ""Exact Sciences is entering an exciting period for its pipeline, generating evidence to support innovative tests that will help defeat cancer through earlier detection,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Kevin Conroy</span>, chairman and CEO. ""Our powerful commercial engine will help us achieve our mission by getting more people tested with Cologuard<sup>®</sup>, Oncotype DX<sup>®</sup>, and our future tests."" <b>Third quarter 2021 financial results</b> <i>For the three-month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2021, as compared to the same period of 2020 (where applicable):</i> Screening includes laboratory service revenue from Cologuard tests and revenue from Biomatrica products. Precision Oncology includes laboratory service revenue from global Oncotype products and laboratory service revenue from Ashion. <b>2021 outlook</b> <b>Non-GAAP disclosure<br class=""dnr""></b>In addition to the company's financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the company provides non-GAAP measures that it determines to be useful in evaluating its operating performance. The company presents EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, as well as non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross profit. EBITDA and adjusted&nbsp;EBITDA consist of net loss after adjustment for those items shown in the table below. The company defines non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin, respectively, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets used in the calculation of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin pertain only to the amortization associated with developed technology acquired and recorded through purchase accounting transactions. The amortization of these intangible assets will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. The company uses this non-GAAP financial information to evaluate ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental information purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross profit exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets although such measures include the revenue associated with the acquisitions. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP, see below ""EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliations"" and ""Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin Reconciliations."" <b>Third quarter conference call &amp; webcast<br class=""dnr""></b>Company management will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, November&nbsp;2, 2021, at <span class=""xn-chron"">5 p.m. ET</span> to discuss third quarter 2021 results.

The Cologuard test&nbsp; is included in the American Cancer Society's (2018) colorectal cancer screening guidelines and the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2021) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). The Cologuard test is indicated to screen adults 45 years of age and older who are at average risk for colorectal cancer by detecting certain DNA markers and blood in the stool. Do not use the Cologuard test if you have had precancer, have inflammatory bowel disease and certain hereditary syndromes, or have a personal or family history of colorectal cancer. The Cologuard test is not a replacement for colonoscopy in high risk patients. The Cologuard test performance in adults ages 45-49 is estimated based on a large clinical study of patients 50 and older. Cologuard performance in repeat testing has not been evaluated. The Cologuard test result should be interpreted with caution. A positive test result does not confirm the presence of cancer. Patients with a positive test result should be referred for diagnostic colonoscopy. A negative test result does not confirm the absence of cancer. Patients with a negative test result should discuss with their doctor when they need to be tested again. Medicare and most major insurers cover the Cologuard test. For more information about the Cologuard test, visit <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3343416-1&amp;h=992189915&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cologuardtest.com%2F&amp;a=www.cologuardtest.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cologuardtest.com</a>. <b>About Oncotype DX<br class=""dnr""></b>The Oncotype DX<sup>®</sup> portfolio of breast, colon and prostate cancer tests applies advanced genomic science to reveal the unique biology of a tumor in order to optimize cancer treatment decisions. In breast cancer, the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score® test is the only test that has been shown to predict the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit as well as recurrence in invasive breast cancer. Additionally, the Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score<sup>®</sup> test predicts the likelihood of recurrence in a pre-invasive form of breast cancer called DCIS. In prostate cancer, the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score<sup>®</sup> test predicts disease aggressiveness and further clarifies the current and future risk of the cancer prior to treatment intervention, and the Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect<sup>®</sup> test helps determine which patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are resistant to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies. The Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect test is performed by Epic Sciences at its centralized, CLIA-certified laboratory in <span class=""xn-location"">San Diego</span> and offered exclusively by Exact Sciences. The Oncotype MAP® Pan-Cancer Tissue test is a rapid, comprehensive tumor profiling panel that aids therapy selection for patients with advanced, metastatic, refractory, or recurrent cancer. With more than 1 million patients tested in more than 90 countries, the Oncotype tests have redefined personalized medicine by making genomics a critical part of cancer diagnosis and treatment.

class=""prnews_span"">81,339</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">____________________</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(1) Represents acquisition and related integration costs incurred as a result of the Company's business combinations and asset acquisitions, a majority of which relates to the acquisition of Thrive Earlier Detection Corp. (""Thrive"") for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021. Stock-based compensation including the incremental fair value of assumed stock awards and accelerated vesting from post-acquisition qualified termination events was $4.5 million and $107.2 million for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021, respectively. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021, $5.2 million of total stock-based compensation costs were related to stock awards that were cash-settled. Stock-based compensation including the incremental fair value of assumed stock awards and accelerated vesting from post-acquisition qualified termination events was $4.2 million and $8.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. Legal and other professional service fees were $3.9 million and $23.2 million for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021, respectively. Legal and other professional service fees were $3.5 million and $11.3 million for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2020, respectively. Expense of $1.8 million and $11.0 million was incurred for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021 resulting from the remeasurement of the contingent consideration liabilities in connection with business combinations. </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(2) During the first quarter of 2021, the Company acquired a worldwide exclusive license to the proprietary Targeted Digital Sequencing (""TARDIS"") technology from The Translational Genomics Research Institute (""TGen""). The acquisition was treated as an asset acquisition under U.S. GAAP and resulted in a $52.3 million charge to research and development expense. During the second quarter of 2021, the Company acquired PFS Genomics, Inc. The acquisition was treated as an asset acquisition under U.S. GAAP and resulted in a $33.1 million charge to research and development expense. </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(3) The loss on settlement of convertible notes represents the difference between (i) the fair value of the consideration transferred and (ii) the sum of the carrying value of the debt at the time of repurchase for $100 million of convertible notes with an original maturity of January 15, 2025. </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(4) As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act""), the Company received $23.7 million from the United States Department of Health and Human Services Provider Relief Fund provided to eligible healthcare providers. The CARES Act funds are meant to offset the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic which include increases in the Company's costs and lost revenues.</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(5) During the third quarter of 2021, the Company determined that the supply agreement intangible asset recorded as part of the combination with Genomic Health was impaired due to the performance of the underlying product. As a result, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements, the Company recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment of $20.2 million. </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">During the third quarter of 2020, the Company began discussions with Biocartis regarding the termination of its agreements related to the development of an in vitro diagnostic version of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test. As a result, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements, the Company recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment loss of $200.0 million related to the in-process research and development intangible asset that was initially recorded as part of the combination with Genomic Health.</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">During the third quarter of 2020, the Company abandoned certain research and development assets acquired through an asset purchase agreement with Armune Biosciences, Inc. in 2017. These assets were expected to complement the Company's product pipeline and were expected to have alternative future uses at the time of acquisition; however, due to changes in strategic priorities and efforts during the third quarter of 2020, these assets are no longer expected to be utilized to advance the Company's product pipeline. As a result, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements, the Company concluded that the intangible asset would need to be written off as of September 30, 2020 which resulted in a non-cash, pre-tax impairment loss of $9.7 million.</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(6) During the third quarter of 2021, the Company presented a settlement offer of approximately $10 million to the United States Department of Justice (""DOJ"") concerning the DOJ's investigation of Genomic Health's compliance with the Medicare Date of Service billing regulations, which was accrued for as of September 30, 2021. This represents the Company's best estimate of the probable loss for this matter, but the recorded amount may be materially adversely affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of this matter. </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(7) Represents severance costs as a result of proactive measures the Company put in place to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We benefited from outstanding execution by our team, strong demand, and relatively low grain stocks - including growth in new markets, such as renewable diesel and supply chain extensions with our new Swiss trading office. We continue to identify opportunities in these volatile markets and remain focused on an anticipated large 2021 harvest. Harvest in the corn belt is progressing and we are pleased that storage income has returned to the wheat and corn markets,"" said President and CEO <span class=""xn-person"">Pat Bowe</span>.&nbsp;  ""Ethanol margins have strengthened through the fall maintenance season and U.S. stocks are low at this time. We are focused on risk management and effective hedging and continue to see strong returns from co-products, particularly distillers' corn oil,"" added Bowe. ""We anticipate strong fourth quarter margins in Ethanol. Plant Nutrient followed up a great first half with a third quarter loss, which was in line with our expectations for this seasonal business. Fertilizer prices and farm income both remain high. We continue to receive good support from our suppliers in this time of tight stocks. Our teams are executing well and remain focused on customer needs and operational excellence.""&nbsp;  ""Lastly, I want to comment on the sale of our Rail leasing business that was announced on <span class=""xn-chron"">August 16</span>,"" stated Bowe. ""This strategic sale allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet and focus on investing in our core agriculture businesses. We completed the acquisition of Capstone Commodities on <span class=""xn-chron"">October 1</span> which helps to expand our supply chain presence to southwestern U.S. dairy customers. We continue to evaluate organic growth projects in grain, renewable fuels, and fertilizer as well as potential acquisitions and investments, with the goal of growing our ag supply chain and renewable fuels businesses while reducing our carbon footprint."" <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$ in millions, except per share amounts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

""This strong cash flow, combined with proceeds from the sale of assets, has enabled us to reduce long-term debt by over <span class=""xn-money"">$300 million</span> since the start of the year. We remain disciplined with capital allocation while ensuring that we are adequately maintaining our physical assets. Short-term borrowings at the end of the quarter have been significantly reduced to <span class=""xn-money"">$281.2 million</span> from the <span class=""xn-money"">$915.2 million</span> balance at the close of our first quarter, which is our typical seasonal high. We are now below our key target of 2.5x long-term debt to adjusted EBITDA and have capacity available for growth in our core agricultural businesses.""  Readily marketable inventories of <span class=""xn-money"">$700 million</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30</span> are a significant increase from the prior year and reflects the overall inflation in commodity prices. The company invested <span class=""xn-money"">$19</span>.8&nbsp;million on capital projects for its continuing operations in the quarter. The company expects to invest approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$85 million</span> in 2021 in its continuing operations.&nbsp; In addition, the company received proceeds of $543&nbsp;million from the sale of its Rail leasing business and other assets. A portion of these proceeds were used to retire long-term debt and reduce outstanding short-term borrowings. <b><u>Third Quarter Segment Overview</u></b> <b>Record Trade Results Driven by Elevation Margins and Merchandising Income Result in <span class=""xn-money"">$20.7 Million</span> Year-Over-Year Improvement </b> The Trade segment had record adjusted pretax income of <span class=""xn-money"">$27.6 million</span> for the quarter compared to adjusted pretax income of <span class=""xn-money"">$6.9 million</span> in the third quarter of 2020. The difference in reported and adjusted pretax income in both periods was attributable to stock compensation expense associated with the 2019 acquisition of Lansing Trade Group, as well as a gain on the sale of a grain asset location in 2021.  Strong elevation margins in <span class=""xn-location"">Idaho</span> and <span class=""xn-location"">Louisiana</span> grain assets led the significant quarter-over-quarter improvement. In addition, new merchandising businesses have added incremental gross profit and earnings. Good overall positioning, risk management, and execution has contributed to year-over-year improved performance. Continued merchandising opportunities are expected throughout the fourth quarter. The harvest outlook remains strong despite delays caused by recent precipitation. A good third quarter wheat harvest accumulated more bushels than expected and an opportunity for storage income with carry in the wheat market. Relatively low stocks are expected to continue past harvest along with higher prices and strong elevation margins are expected to continue into 2022. Trade's third quarter adjusted EBITDA was <span class=""xn-money"">$43.9 million</span>, nearly double the third quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA of <span class=""xn-money"">$22.3 million</span>.  <b>Ethanol Records a Pretax Loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$3.6 Million</span> on Higher Corn Basis; Co-Product Values and Trading Remain Strong</b> The Ethanol segment reported a pretax loss attributable to the company of <span class=""xn-money"">$3.6 million</span> in the third quarter compared to the pretax income attributable to the company of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.1 million</span> it realized in the same period in 2020.  The quarter-over-quarter decline was driven by higher corn basis at all five ethanol plants eroding any board crush margins. Partially offsetting the ethanol margin decline was increased high-protein feed values and continuing corn oil strength. Profitable third-party trading of ethanol, feed ingredients, and vegetable oil exceeded last year's third quarter. Stocks of ethanol are at very low levels leading to ethanol board crush margins that are positive into the first quarter and despite a projected seasonal slowdown in gasoline demand. Industry production increases are expected in response. Sales volumes for ethanol, corn oil, and feed ingredients were up, driven by higher production and additional third-party sales from the trading business. Hedges on forward ethanol production are in place for a portion of expected production.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ethanol recorded EBITDA of <span class=""xn-money"">$19.2 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021, down <span class=""xn-money"">$5.2 million</span> from 2020 third quarter EBITDA of <span class=""xn-money"">$24.4 million</span>. <b>Plant Nutrient Results Nominally Lower than 2020</b> The Plant Nutrient segment posted a pretax loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$5.8 million</span>, compared to the pretax loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$5.4 million</span> last year. Gross profit for the group was up <span class=""xn-money"">$1.4 million</span> from good demand and strong margins in our agricultural product lines resulting from continued strength in both fertilizer prices and farmer income. High raw material costs and plant labor challenges lowered results for our turf and specialty products. Plant Nutrient's EBITDA was <span class=""xn-money"">$1.8 million</span> compared to 2020 third quarter EBITDA of <span class=""xn-money"">$2.2 million</span>.  <b>Income Taxes; Corporate</b> The company has recorded income taxes from continuing operations at an effective rate of 24.7% for the third quarter and anticipates a full year effective rate of approximately 22%-25%.  Increases in corporate expense are due to variable incentive compensation and stranded costs from the sale of our Rail leasing business.&nbsp;  <b>Conference Call</b> The company will host a webcast on <span class=""xn-chron"">Wednesday, November 3, 2021</span>, at <span class=""xn-chron"">11 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time</span>, to discuss its performance and provide its updated outlook for 2021 and preliminary views for 2022.

<span class=""prnews_span"">Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to The Andersons, Inc. reflects reported net income (loss) from continuing operations available to The Andersons, Inc. common shareholders after the removal of specified items described above. Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share reflects the fully diluted EPS of The Andersons, Inc. after removal of the effect on EPS as reported of specified items described above. Management believes that Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to The Andersons, Inc. and Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share are useful measures of The Andersons, Inc. performance as they provide investors additional information about the operations of the company allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better comparability to previous periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace or be alternatives to Net income attributable to The Andersons, Inc. and Diluted earnings attributable to The Andersons, Inc. common shareholders as reported, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, or any other measures of operating results under GAAP. Earnings amounts described above have been divided by the company's average number of diluted shares outstanding for each respective period in order to arrive at an adjusted diluted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share amount for each specified item.</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>The Andersons, Inc.</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Segment Data</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(unaudited)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(in thousands)</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Trade</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Ethanol</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Plant<br class=""dnr"">Nutrient</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Other</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Total</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Three months ended September 30, 2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Sales and merchandising revenues</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2,242,131</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>614,637</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>142,056</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>—</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2,998,824</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Gross profit</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>98,196</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>5,751</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>17,888</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>—</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>121,835</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Operating, administrative and general expenses</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>67,590</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>10,014</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>22,883</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>9,788</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>110,275</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Other income (loss), net</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>16,886</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>683</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>309</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(4,072)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>13,806</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Income (loss) before income taxes from continuing operations</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>41,999</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(5,238)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(5,832)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(14,612)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>16,317</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>—</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(1,602)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>—</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>—</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(1,602)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Income (loss) before income taxes from continuing operations attributable to <br class=""dnr"">The Andersons, Inc.

class=""prnews_span"">126,256</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Cash from operations before working capital changes is defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activities before the impact of changes in working capital within the statement of cash flows. The Company calculates cash from operations by eliminating the effect of changes in accounts receivable, inventories, commodity derivatives, other assets, and payables and accrued expenses from the cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Management believes that cash from operations before working capital changes is a useful measure of the company's performance as it provides investors additional information about the company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and improved comparability to prior periods. Cash from operations before working capital changes is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace or be an alternative to cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.</span> SOURCE The Andersons, Inc.  <a title=""Link to http://www.andersonsinc.com"" href=""http://www.andersonsinc.com/"" class=""linkOnClick"" data-include="""" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.andersonsinc.com</a><br> More news releases in similar topics <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>

The reconciliations between the pro forma and GAAP financial results for the relevant periods are provided in the tables following the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below. <b>Recent Financial Highlights:</b> ""I am pleased that we delivered record financial results in the second quarter, but even more pleased with how we have strategically laid the foundation to capture a dramatically expanded market opportunity set in future quarters and years,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Bill Stone</span>, CEO. ""Our first full quarter reporting as a consolidated entity provided early evidence of the financial benefits from our greater scope and scale. Meanwhile, we are now strategically positioning the Company for continued success in the future with a fully differentiated end-to-end platform.&nbsp; The integration is proceeding ahead of our own initial expectations and has been very well-received by partners and customers across the full spectrum of the platform.&nbsp; Revenue synergies are already materializing ahead of our expectations, even though we are merely at the onset of exploiting our platform's inherent competitive advantages. Execution continues to be our primary focus, as we confidently aspire to realize far greater, more strategic synergies in future quarters."" Mr. Stone concluded, ""With respect to our financial performance during the September quarter, we continued to witness strong demand from app publishers and advertisers for our unique set of product offerings across the full range of the platform.&nbsp; Our On-Device Media revenue and our In-App Media revenue each increased more than 60% year-over-year on a pro forma basis.&nbsp; Within the On-Device Media segment, our primary health metric, revenue-per-device (""RPD""), increased more than 50% year-over-year on devices in the U.S., and more than 100% on devices outside of the U.S. during what was an all-time record quarter for the total number of new devices activated globally with our software installed.&nbsp; Scale efficiencies and disciplined expense controls once again enabled us to translate this top-line growth into non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS growth of more than 190% on a year-over-year basis. We expect to continue to demonstrate incremental profitable operating leverage, particularly as we realize considerable additional acquisition-related synergies. In summary, I am more upbeat than ever about the Company's future, as I believe that our 'One DT' platform is ideally positioned to not only <i>adapt</i>&nbsp;to, but will in fact fully <i>benefit </i>from, several key developing trends within our industry, such as the diversification of ad spend into other fully calculable performance-driven options, legislative and regulatory actions designed to foster alternative market opportunities, and the recent wave of ad-tech consolidation which has reduced the number of independent competitors, thereby further differentiating the uniqueness of our strategic market approach."" <b>Fiscal 2022 Second Quarter Financial Results</b> Total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was <span class=""xn-money"">$310.2 million</span>.&nbsp; Total ""On-Device Media"" revenue, which represents revenue derived from the Company's Application Media and Content Media platform products, increased 73% year-over-year to <span class=""xn-money"">$129.4 million</span>.&nbsp; Before intercompany eliminations, total ""In-App Media"" revenue, which represents revenue derived from the Fyber and AdColony businesses, increased 61% year-over-year on a pro forma basis to <span class=""xn-money"">$187.2 million</span>.&nbsp; Fyber contributed <span class=""xn-money"">$125.7 million</span> during the quarter, while AdColony contributed <span class=""xn-money"">$61.5 million</span> during the quarter. GAAP net loss for the fiscal second quarter of 2022, inclusive of a <span class=""xn-money"">$22.1 million</span> fair value adjustment to the contingent acquisition-related earn-outs, was <span class=""xn-money"">$5.9 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">($0.06)</span> per share, as compared to GAAP net income from continuing operations of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.4 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.00</span> per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2021.&nbsp; Non-GAAP adjusted net income<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was <span class=""xn-money"">$45.3 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.44</span> per share, as compared to Non-GAAP adjusted net income of <span class=""xn-money"">$14.5 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.15</span> per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was <span class=""xn-money"">$47.9 million</span> as compared to Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of <span class=""xn-money"">$16.5 million</span> in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP financial results for all referenced periods are provided in the tables immediately following the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below. <b>Business Outlook</b> Based on information available as of <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2, 2021</span>, the Company currently expects the following for the third quarter of fiscal 2022: It is not reasonably practicable to provide a business outlook for GAAP net income because the Company cannot reasonably estimate the changes in stock-based compensation expense, which is directly impacted by changes in the Company's stock price, any adjustment to the contingent earn-out provisions, which will continue to be adjusted to fair value through the end of the earn-out periods, or other items that are difficult to predict with precision. <b>About Digital Turbine, Inc.</b> Digital Turbine is the leading independent mobile growth platform and levels up the landscape for advertisers, publishers, carriers and OEMS.&nbsp; By integrating a full ad stack with proprietary technology built into devices by wireless operators and OEMs, Digital Turbine supercharges advertising and monetization.

The conference call will discuss forward guidance and other material information. <b>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b> To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Digital Turbine uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP adjusted net income and earnings per share (""EPS"") and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. Reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables below. Non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance, prospects for the future and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain expenses and benefits that may not be indicative of recurring core business operating results. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures that exclude such items when viewed in conjunction with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations enhance the comparability of results against prior periods and allow for greater transparency of financial results. The Company believes non-GAAP measures facilitate management's internal comparison of its financial performance to that of prior periods as well as trend analysis for budgeting and planning purposes. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. <sup>1</sup>Non-GAAP adjusted net income and EPS are defined as GAAP net income and EPS adjusted to exclude the effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, adjustments in the fair value of earn-out liabilities associated with acquisitions, and transaction-related expenses and compensation costs. Readers are cautioned that non-GAAP adjusted net income and EPS should not be construed as an alternative to comparable GAAP net income figures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an indicator of profitability or performance, which is the most comparable measure under GAAP. <sup>2</sup>Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is calculated as GAAP net income excluding the following cash and non-cash expenses: net interest income/(expense), adjustments in the fair value of earn-out liabilities associated with acquisitions, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles, foreign exchange transactions, and transaction-related expenses and compensation costs. Readers are cautioned that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an indicator of performance, which is the most comparable measure under GAAP. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted net income and EPS are used by management as internal measures of profitability and performance. They have been included because the Company believes that the measures are used by certain investors to assess the Company's financial performance before non-cash charges and certain costs that the Company does not believe are reflective of its underlying business. <b>Forward-Looking Statements</b> This news release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

 Company reinforces strength of its core business and vision of building an integrated and digital real estate transaction to shop for, buy, sell, finance and close on homes News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:05 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">SEATTLE</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zillow-group-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results--shares-plan-to-wind-down-zillow-offers-operations-301414460.html#financial-modal"">Z</a> and ZG), today announced consolidated financial results for the three months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">Sept. 30, 2021</span>, and its plan to wind down Zillow Offers, the company's iBuying service in which Zillow acts as the primary purchaser and seller of homes.  ""We've determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated and continuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility,"" said Zillow Group co-founder and CEO <span class=""xn-person"">Rich Barton</span>. ""While we built and learned a tremendous amount operating Zillow Offers, it served only a small portion of our customers. Our core business and brand are strong, and we remain committed to creating an integrated and digital real estate transaction that solves the pain points of buyers and sellers while serving a wider audience."" The wind-down is expected to take several quarters and will include a reduction of Zillow's workforce by approximately 25%. ""The most difficult part of this decision is that it will impact many of our colleagues,"" Barton said. ""This is not something we take lightly. We are grateful for their efforts, and we are committed to providing a smooth transition."" The company reported the following Q3 financial results:  Included in the company's third-quarter financial results is a write-down of inventory of approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$304 million</span> within the Homes segment as a result of purchasing homes in Q3 at higher prices than the company's current estimates of future selling prices. The company further expects an additional <span class=""xn-money"">$240 million</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$265 million</span> of losses to be recognized in Q4 primarily on homes it expects to purchase in Q4. Additionally, Homes segment Q3 revenue is below the company's previously provided outlook range due to resale capacity constraints that pushed a number of closings into Q4 that were previously expected to close in Q3.

We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA in total to net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA by segment to income (loss) before income taxes for each segment, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA in total and for each segment has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA in total and for each segment alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss), income (loss) before income taxes for each segment, and our other GAAP results. <b>About Zillow Group, Inc.</b> Zillow Group, Inc.

Overall total sales in the third quarter of 2021 were 644,000 tons, up 50% from 430,000 tons in the third quarter of 2020. Cash margins on Company produced coal were <span class=""xn-money"">$34</span> per ton in the third quarter of 2021, up 278% from the same period of 2020. Pricing of Company produced coal sold was <span class=""xn-money"">$105</span> per ton, which was 35% higher in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020. Company produced cash mine costs were <span class=""xn-money"">$71</span> per ton in the third quarter of 2021, which were 3% higher than the same period of 2020. Despite higher sales-related costs, as well as modest inflationary pressures, cash mine costs at <span class=""xn-location"">Elk Creek</span> of <span class=""xn-money"">$67</span> per ton in the third quarter of 2021 were equal to the same period of 2020.  <b><u>Sequential Quarter Comparison<br class=""dnr""></u></b>Total sales volume of 644,000 tons in the third quarter of 2021 was down 6% from the second quarter of 2021.  Cash margins on Company produced coal increased by 26% from the second quarter of 2021, due to higher revenue per ton sold in the third quarter of 2021. Cash mine costs on Company produced coal were <span class=""xn-money"">$71</span> in the third quarter of 2021 per ton compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$69</span> per ton in the second quarter of 2021. Higher cash costs were due to higher sales-related costs, on the back of higher revenue per ton. Specifically, the 3% sequential increase in cash costs per ton was more than offset by 9% higher revenue per ton sold in the third quarter of 2021 relative to the second quarter of 2021.  Other income was <span class=""xn-money"">$0.8 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021 compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$3.4 million</span> in the second quarter of 2021, principally due to the recognition of <span class=""xn-money"">$2.9 million</span> in the second quarter of 2021 for the CARES Act Employee Retention Tax Credit.  <b>Additional Financial Results</b> At <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, the Company had record liquidity of <span class=""xn-money"">$73.8 million</span>, consisting of <span class=""xn-money"">$46.7 million</span> of cash on hand plus <span class=""xn-money"">$27.1 million</span> of availability under its revolving credit facility.  Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2021 totaled <span class=""xn-money"">$9.1 million</span>, an increase of 264% as compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$2.5 million</span> for the third quarter of 2020. This increase was principally due to the continued development of the <span class=""xn-location"">Berwind</span> complex in 2021.  The Company's effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 21%, excluding a tax benefit of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.2 million</span> for legislative changes in <span class=""xn-location"">West Virginia</span>. The 21% rate is above our first half of 2021 effective tax rate of 9% excluding discreet items. The difference between our first half of 2021 rate of 9% and our third quarter of 2021 rate of 21% negatively impacted net income by approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$0.8 million</span> and EPS of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.02</span>. Ramaco expects to continue to pay minimal cash taxes due to tax loss carryforwards. On <span class=""xn-chron"">July 13, 2021</span>, the Company completed a <span class=""xn-money"">$34.5 million</span> senior unsecured notes offering. The 9.00% notes mature in <span class=""xn-chron"">July 2026</span>. The notes are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ""METCL"". On <span class=""xn-chron"">July 16, 2021</span>, the Company was awarded a <span class=""xn-money"">$32.7 million</span> jury verdict in its lawsuit related to the <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2018</span> silo failure against Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. (""Chubb Insurance""), which has not yet been paid and is subject to potential appeal and post-trial motions. On <span class=""xn-chron"">July 29, 2021</span>, the Company was informed that the SBA had forgiven an approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$8.4 million</span> PPP Loan which had been granted to the Company in 2020.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer noted, ""This has been a transformative year for Ramaco. As the year has progressed, the markets have served to reward the hard work our team has done to position the Company to take advantage of what we feel will be a multi-year cycle of strength in the metallurgical coal markets. We have been able to achieve new milestones both operationally and financially. Indeed, having started less than five years ago from literally scratch, today we now stand as a company with roughly a <span class=""xn-money"">$800 million</span> market value.  Through our recently concluded 2022 North American coal sales, the markets have now propelled us into an entirely new financial realm.  As previously announced, we recently concluded 2022 fixed priced sales to our North American customers of 1.67 million tons at an average price of <span class=""xn-money"">$196</span> per short ton FOB mine. Through these sales, we have essentially now booked for 2022 over <span class=""xn-money"">$325 million</span> of revenue and roughly <span class=""xn-money"">$190 million</span> in Adjusted EBITDA.  In addition to these booked sales we have retained almost half of our planned 3.1 million tons of production for 2022 to be sold into export markets, at what is currently higher index-based pricing. The impact of these sales will provide us with new levels of cash generation and financial optionality that we have not previously enjoyed.  Further, we expect continued underlying strength in the steel and metallurgical markets to provide the underpinning for longer term met coal demand and elevated pricing over the next few years. As we have said before, met coal is a proxy for steel and steel in turn is a proxy for a country's economic condition. The U.S. economy is now accelerating at a historically high level and nominal GDP this year has grown at a rate of almost 8%. I view the current macro environment as it applies to us as somewhat like the four legs of a stool. First, on the demand side, all of the developed economies are rebounding from the COVID-19 impact at roughly the same time. Second, there has been fiscal stimulus injected into these economies on a scale we have frankly not seen before. More may indeed come. Third, this expansion of the world's money supply has had the predictable effect of creating conditions for an inflationary impact that will no doubt affect pricing in hard assets like coal for an extended period. These three legs create a natural underlying demand for steel and, hence, metallurgical coal. The fourth leg is the supply equation. Perversely, coal as a commodity is in an existential period. Despite its continued strong worldwide demand, there are financial and regulatory forces that have created an arbitrary constraint on both new capital availability and, hence, new supply. We do not anticipate these conditions changing any time soon. Nor, do we sense there will be any near-term supply response sufficient to balance demand for the foreseeable future. Turning to another recent milestone, I am delighted that we have announced the purchase from Coronado of what are referred to as the Amonate Assets. This <span class=""xn-money"">$30 million</span> purchase will almost immediately be accretive to the Company. It is expected to add 700,000 tons of new low-volatile production by the end of 2023, including 200,000 tons in 2022. It will also save millions of dollars of avoided trucking costs on all existing <span class=""xn-location"">Berwind</span> production beginning in <span class=""xn-chron"">June 2022</span>. Specifically, instead of trucking the raw <span class=""xn-location"">Berwind</span> coal almost 25 miles to our Knox Creek prep plant, we will simply belt the coal by conveyor to the adjacent Amonate prep facility less than half a mile away. On the financial front, in recognition of our significantly increased revenue anticipated in 2022, our principal bank lender, KeyBank, N.A., has agreed to increase the overall availability under our revolving credit line to <span class=""xn-money"">$40 million</span>, from its current <span class=""xn-money"">$30 million</span> level. We view this successful transaction as continued validation of both our creditworthiness, as well as our conservative financial strategy since inception, to maintain minimal net debt and asset retirement obligations. Lastly, when Ramaco went public in 2017, we said that we anticipated returning capital to our shareholders by becoming a regular dividend paying company. Our gating requirement would be a subjective point when we felt we had both reached sufficient scale and felt comfortable we would continue to generate sustainable free cash flow. I am pleased to report that our Board of Directors has now authorized the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend to be paid beginning in the first quarter of 2022. The amount of the dividend and timing of both the record date and payment date will be set at the Company's Board meeting to be held in early December. We hope to regularly increase this dividend in the years ahead as we continue to grow. All of the above has created a uniquely positive outlook for Ramaco as we look forward to both the balance of this year and beyond into 2022. We remain positioned to benefit from a number of factors. These include the future doubling of our low-cost/high-quality production capacity to meet near and medium-term demand growth, a continuing period of strong index-based pricing, a formidable balance sheet and the impending roll-off of much lower priced 2021 domestic met coal contracts.  We still maintain over 100,000 tons of high-quality met coal production to sell at today's elevated pricing into the balance of 2021. Yet, given our recently announced new sales, we cannot wait for 2022 to arrive. We will be starting out of the gate in the new year with nearly 1.7 million tons already booked for sale at almost <span class=""xn-money"">$200</span> per ton, against year-to- date 2021 cash costs of <span class=""xn-money"">$67</span> per ton, and an almost equal amount of remaining unsold production to sell into one of the strongest markets we have seen.  2021 promises to be our strongest year of free cash flow since we became public. 2022 already is expected to be a multiple of that. We should reach a point next year where we will generate sufficient free cash flow to be completely self-financed to execute our organic growth plans to grow Ramaco to roughly 5 million tons of production. Indeed, over the next few years we expect a continued period of significant free cash flow generation and a commitment to continue a regular return of capital to our shareholders."" <span class=""prnews_span""><b><u>2021 Guidance</u></b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>(In thousands, except per ton amounts and percentages)</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021&nbsp;Guidance</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020 Actuals</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><u>Company Production</u></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Elk Creek</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp; 2,000 - 2,050</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,548</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Triad</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp; 125 - 175</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">—</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Berwind</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp; 25 - 75</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">147</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Big Creek</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp; 50 - 100</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">—</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Total</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp; 2,200 - 2,400</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,695</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><u>Sales Mix</u><sup>&nbsp;(a)</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Metallurgical</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp; 2,225 -&nbsp; 2,350</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,749</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Steam</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50 - 75</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">—</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Total</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp; 2,275 - 2,425</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,749</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><u>Cost Per Ton</u></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Elk Creek</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 63 - 65</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">70</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><u>Other</u></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Capital Expenditures <sup>(b)</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">26,000 - 28,000</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">24,753</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Selling, general and administrative expense <sup>(c)</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">15,000 - 16,000</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">16,883</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Depreciation and amortization expense</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">24,000 - 26,000</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">20,912</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Interest expense, net</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp; 2,000 -&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,500</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,224</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Cash taxes</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">19</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Effective tax rate<sup> (d)</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 - 15%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">20%</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>(a)</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>2021 guidance includes a small amount purchased coal.</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>(b)</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>Excludes purchase price of Amonate.

used as a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies.&nbsp;We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus net interest expense, equity-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses and any transaction related costs. Its most comparable GAAP measure is net income. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is included below. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to serve as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Three months ended September&nbsp;30,&nbsp;</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Nine months ended September&nbsp;30,&nbsp;</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><i>(In thousands)</i></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Net income (loss)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">7,035</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(4,776)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">21,120</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(162)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Depreciation and amortization</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">6,751</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">5,258</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">18,861</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">15,601</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Interest expense, net</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">933</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">344</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,418</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">915</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Income tax expense (benefit)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,588</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(1,407)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,650</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(38)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">EBITDA</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">16,307</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(581)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">43,049</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">16,316</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Stock-based compensation</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,342</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,090</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">3,919</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">3,119</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Accretion of asset retirement obligations</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">156</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">128</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">461</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">428</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Adjusted EBITDA</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">17,805</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">637</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">47,429</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">19,863</span> <i>Non-GAAP&nbsp;revenue&nbsp;and cash cost per&nbsp;ton</i> Non-GAAP revenue per ton (FOB mine) is calculated as coal sales revenue less transportation costs, divided by tons sold. Non-GAAP cash cost per ton sold is calculated as cash cost of coal sales less transportation costs, divided by tons sold. We believe revenue per ton (FOB mine) and cash cost per ton provides useful information to investors as these enable investors to compare revenue per ton and cash cost per ton for the Company against similar measures made by other publicly-traded coal companies and more effectively monitor changes in coal prices and costs from period to period excluding the impact of transportation costs, which are beyond our control. The adjustments made to arrive at these measures are significant in understanding and assessing the Company's financial condition. Revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) and cash cost per ton are not measures of financial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and therefore should not be considered as an alternative to revenue and cost of sales under U.S. GAAP.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:05 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">FAIRFAX, Va.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp; <b>Third Quarter Highlights:</b> <b>—Increases GAAP EPS and Non-GAAP EPS Guidance for Full Year 2021</b><b> and Operating Cash Flow Guidance to <span class=""xn-money"">$110 Million</span></b><b>—</b> <b>—Substantial Backlog and Record Business Development Pipeline Support Continued Growth in 2022—</b> <b>—Announces Acquisition of ESAC, an Innovative Provider of Advanced Public Health Technology Solutions—</b> ICF (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/icf-reports-third-quarter-2021-results-301414557.html#financial-modal"">ICFI</a>), a global consulting and digital services provider, reported results for the third quarter ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>. Commenting on the results, <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344554-1&amp;h=1922551389&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.icf.com%2Fcompany%2Fabout%2Four-people%2Fw%2Fwasson-john&amp;a=John+Wasson"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""xn-person"">John Wasson</span></a>, chairman and chief executive officer, said, ""We continued to deliver strong results in the third quarter, led by double-digit growth in revenue from government clients and the steady growth of commercial energy. Similarly, year-to-date growth in these client categories has been robust, with government up 14% and commercial energy up 8.7%, representing 88% of nine-month revenue in the aggregate.  ""ICF's year-to-date 7.1% increase in service revenue demonstrates how well our domain expertise and qualifications are aligned with market demand. This performance reflects the combined strength of our growth markets, including IT modernization, public health and disaster management, which together with our climate, environmental consulting and utility programs continued to drive positive revenue comparisons for both the third quarter and nine-month periods. ""Operating income increased 14.2% in the third quarter, benefitting from higher utilization, the timing of energy efficiency incentive fees, lower depreciation and amortization expense and reduced facility-related costs. Although certain operating expense items will increase in future periods in tandem with the return of pre-pandemic activities, we believe that ICF's diversified business model will continue to yield operating leverage. ""We are very pleased with the pace of our contract awards, which at <span class=""xn-money"">$604 million</span> represented a 1.5 book-to-bill ratio for the third quarter, and approximately two-thirds of the <span class=""xn-money"">$1.6 billion</span> in contract wins in the first nine months related to the capture of new business.  ""Today we announced the acquisition of ESAC, also known as Enterprise Science and Computing, a highly specialized 40-person firm with advanced health analytics and bioinformatics capabilities that will expand ICF's services at existing federal government clients in the public health arena. ESAC has contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs and other federal agencies, in addition to its roster of academic, federally funded research centers and private organizations. Importantly, ESAC is an excellent cultural fit with ICF, bringing deep expertise at the juncture of biomedical science and technology and the strong commitment of its people to improve all aspects of human health,"" Mr. Wasson said. <b>Third Quarter 2021 Results</b> Third quarter 2021 total revenue was <span class=""xn-money"">$394.1 million</span>, an increase of 9.4% from the <span class=""xn-money"">$360.3 million</span> reported in the third quarter of 2020. Service revenue increased 4.1% year-over-year to <span class=""xn-money"">$275.6 million</span>, from <span class=""xn-money"">$264.7 million</span>. Net income amounted to <span class=""xn-money"">$20.4 million</span> in the third quarter, and diluted EPS was <span class=""xn-money"">$1.07</span> per share, increases of 14.1% and 13.8%, respectively, over net income of <span class=""xn-money"">$17.9 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.94</span> per diluted share, reported last year.  Non-GAAP EPS was <span class=""xn-money"">$1.32</span> per share, an increase of 19.5% over the <span class=""xn-money"">$1.10</span> per share reported in the year-ago quarter. EBITDA¹ was <span class=""xn-money"">$39.9 million</span>, 8.2% ahead of the <span class=""xn-money"">$36.9 million</span> reported in the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA¹ was <span class=""xn-money"">$43.8 million</span>, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$37.8 million</span> reported in the comparable quarter of 2020. Third quarter 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin on service revenue was 15.9%, representing a 160-basis point increase from the 14.3% reported in the 2020 third quarter, reflecting the timing of energy efficiency incentive fees, strong program execution, higher utilization and lower indirect expenses as a percentage of revenue.  <b>Backlog and New Business Awards </b> Total backlog was <span class=""xn-money"">$3.1 billion</span> at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Funded backlog was <span class=""xn-money"">$1.7 billion</span>, or approximately 55% of the total backlog. The total value of contracts awarded in the 2021 third quarter was <span class=""xn-money"">$604 million</span> for a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1.53. Trailing-twelve-month contract awards totaled <span class=""xn-money"">$2.12 billion</span> for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.33. <b>Government Revenue Third Quarter 2021 Highlights </b> Revenue from government clients was <span class=""xn-money"">$285.9 million</span>, up 16.1% year-over-year. <b>Key Government Contracts Awarded in the Third Quarter 2021</b> ICF was awarded more than 200 U.S. federal contracts and task orders and more than 200 additional contracts from U.S. state and local and international governments with an aggregate value of over <span class=""xn-money"">$525 million</span>. Notable awards won in the third quarter 2021 included: <b><i>Public Health</i></b> <b><i>Disaster Management</i></b> <b><i>IT Modernization</i></b> <b><i>Environment and Energy</i></b> <b><i>Training and Technical Assistance</i></b>&nbsp; <b>Commercial Revenue Third Quarter 2021 Highlights </b> Commercial revenue was <span class=""xn-money"">$108.2 million</span>, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$114.2 million</span> in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the completion of a large marketing services contract at the end of last year.  <b>Key Commercial Contracts Awarded in the Third Quarter 2021</b> ICF was awarded almost 600 commercial projects globally during the quarter including: <b><i>Energy Markets</i></b> <b><i>Marketing Services</i></b> <b>Dividend Declaration</b> On <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2, 2021</span>, ICF declared a quarterly cash dividend of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.14</span> per share, payable on <span class=""xn-chron"">January 12, 2022</span>, to shareholders of record on <span class=""xn-chron"">December 10, 2021</span>. <b>Summary and Outlook </b> ""ICF's year-to-date performance has set the stage for 2021 to be a year of substantial growth and has led us to increase our guidance ranges for full year GAAP EPS and Non-GAAP EPS. The revised ranges of <span class=""xn-money"">$4.05</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$4.25</span> for GAAP EPS and <span class=""xn-money"">$4.70</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$4.90</span> for Non-GAAP EPS represent year-on-year growth of 44.6% and 15.1%, respectively, at the midpoints. EBITDA is expected to be at the high end of the range or slightly above. The guidance ranges for total revenue and service revenue remain the same. As previously disclosed and referenced above, total revenue in this year's fourth quarter will reflect a significant year-on-year reduction in pass-through revenues associated with the completion of the large commercial marketing contract in the 2020 fourth quarter. Conversely, we expect fourth quarter service revenue to be similar to third quarter levels, with growth in government and commercial energy client work more than offsetting lower comparisons in commercial marketing services, where activity has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Also, we are raising our full year operating cash flow guidance to <span class=""xn-money"">$110 million</span> from <span class=""xn-money"">$100 million</span>. ""In the first nine months of 2021, ICF derived over 60% of service revenue from work in key growth areas in which we expect growth rates, in the aggregate, to be at least 10% over the next several years. These areas include IT modernization, public health, disaster management and utility consulting as well as climate, environment and infrastructure, which align well with the current administration's priorities and expected government funding, as well as with utility and other commercial energy spending trends. At the end of the third quarter, our business development pipeline was a record&nbsp;$7.3 billion, after winning over <span class=""xn-money"">$600 million</span> in new awards, and represented a diversified set of opportunities in areas in which ICF has built substantial expertise and experience. This robust pipeline together with our substantial backlog will support ICF's continued growth in 2022 and beyond. ""Underpinning the strength of these forward-looking metrics is the ICF culture, which has attracted an exceptional group of people dedicated to making a difference by bringing together subject matter expertise with a broad range of cross-cutting skills that enable us to deliver positive results for our clients. We have accelerated our investments in recruitment and retention to ensure that ICF has the top talent to support our future growth, which is especially important in today's business environment.  ""ICF works every day to demonstrate its commitment to carbon neutrality, diversity, social justice and equality. We encourage you to visit our website to learn more about how ICF addresses its environmental, social and governance responsibilities,"" Mr. Wasson concluded.  <sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Non-GAAP EPS, Service Revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin on Service Revenue are non-GAAP measurements.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:05 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">MADISON, Wis.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;Exact Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/exact-sciences-announces-third-quarter-2021-results-301414569.html#financial-modal"">EXAS</a>) today announced that the company generated revenue of <span class=""xn-money"">$456.4 million</span> for the third quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2021, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$408.4 million</span> for the same period of 2020. ""Exact Sciences is entering an exciting period for its pipeline, generating evidence to support innovative tests that will help defeat cancer through earlier detection,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Kevin Conroy</span>, chairman and CEO. ""Our powerful commercial engine will help us achieve our mission by getting more people tested with Cologuard<sup>®</sup>, Oncotype DX<sup>®</sup>, and our future tests."" <b>Third quarter 2021 financial results</b> <i>For the three-month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2021, as compared to the same period of 2020 (where applicable):</i> Screening includes laboratory service revenue from Cologuard tests and revenue from Biomatrica products. Precision Oncology includes laboratory service revenue from global Oncotype products and laboratory service revenue from Ashion. <b>2021 outlook</b> <b>Non-GAAP disclosure<br class=""dnr""></b>In addition to the company's financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the company provides non-GAAP measures that it determines to be useful in evaluating its operating performance. The company presents EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, as well as non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross profit. EBITDA and adjusted&nbsp;EBITDA consist of net loss after adjustment for those items shown in the table below. The company defines non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin, respectively, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets used in the calculation of non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin pertain only to the amortization associated with developed technology acquired and recorded through purchase accounting transactions. The amortization of these intangible assets will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. The company uses this non-GAAP financial information to evaluate ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental information purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP gross profit exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets although such measures include the revenue associated with the acquisitions. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP, see below ""EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliations"" and ""Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin Reconciliations."" <b>Third quarter conference call &amp; webcast<br class=""dnr""></b>Company management will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, November&nbsp;2, 2021, at <span class=""xn-chron"">5 p.m. ET</span> to discuss third quarter 2021 results.

The Cologuard test&nbsp; is included in the American Cancer Society's (2018) colorectal cancer screening guidelines and the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2021) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). The Cologuard test is indicated to screen adults 45 years of age and older who are at average risk for colorectal cancer by detecting certain DNA markers and blood in the stool. Do not use the Cologuard test if you have had precancer, have inflammatory bowel disease and certain hereditary syndromes, or have a personal or family history of colorectal cancer. The Cologuard test is not a replacement for colonoscopy in high risk patients. The Cologuard test performance in adults ages 45-49 is estimated based on a large clinical study of patients 50 and older. Cologuard performance in repeat testing has not been evaluated. The Cologuard test result should be interpreted with caution. A positive test result does not confirm the presence of cancer. Patients with a positive test result should be referred for diagnostic colonoscopy. A negative test result does not confirm the absence of cancer. Patients with a negative test result should discuss with their doctor when they need to be tested again. Medicare and most major insurers cover the Cologuard test. For more information about the Cologuard test, visit <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3343416-1&amp;h=992189915&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cologuardtest.com%2F&amp;a=www.cologuardtest.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cologuardtest.com</a>. <b>About Oncotype DX<br class=""dnr""></b>The Oncotype DX<sup>®</sup> portfolio of breast, colon and prostate cancer tests applies advanced genomic science to reveal the unique biology of a tumor in order to optimize cancer treatment decisions. In breast cancer, the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score® test is the only test that has been shown to predict the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit as well as recurrence in invasive breast cancer. Additionally, the Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score<sup>®</sup> test predicts the likelihood of recurrence in a pre-invasive form of breast cancer called DCIS. In prostate cancer, the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score<sup>®</sup> test predicts disease aggressiveness and further clarifies the current and future risk of the cancer prior to treatment intervention, and the Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect<sup>®</sup> test helps determine which patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are resistant to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies. The Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect test is performed by Epic Sciences at its centralized, CLIA-certified laboratory in <span class=""xn-location"">San Diego</span> and offered exclusively by Exact Sciences. The Oncotype MAP® Pan-Cancer Tissue test is a rapid, comprehensive tumor profiling panel that aids therapy selection for patients with advanced, metastatic, refractory, or recurrent cancer. With more than 1 million patients tested in more than 90 countries, the Oncotype tests have redefined personalized medicine by making genomics a critical part of cancer diagnosis and treatment.

class=""prnews_span"">81,339</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">____________________</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(1) Represents acquisition and related integration costs incurred as a result of the Company's business combinations and asset acquisitions, a majority of which relates to the acquisition of Thrive Earlier Detection Corp. (""Thrive"") for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021. Stock-based compensation including the incremental fair value of assumed stock awards and accelerated vesting from post-acquisition qualified termination events was $4.5 million and $107.2 million for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021, respectively. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021, $5.2 million of total stock-based compensation costs were related to stock awards that were cash-settled. Stock-based compensation including the incremental fair value of assumed stock awards and accelerated vesting from post-acquisition qualified termination events was $4.2 million and $8.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. Legal and other professional service fees were $3.9 million and $23.2 million for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021, respectively. Legal and other professional service fees were $3.5 million and $11.3 million for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2020, respectively. Expense of $1.8 million and $11.0 million was incurred for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2021 resulting from the remeasurement of the contingent consideration liabilities in connection with business combinations. </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(2) During the first quarter of 2021, the Company acquired a worldwide exclusive license to the proprietary Targeted Digital Sequencing (""TARDIS"") technology from The Translational Genomics Research Institute (""TGen""). The acquisition was treated as an asset acquisition under U.S. GAAP and resulted in a $52.3 million charge to research and development expense. During the second quarter of 2021, the Company acquired PFS Genomics, Inc. The acquisition was treated as an asset acquisition under U.S. GAAP and resulted in a $33.1 million charge to research and development expense. </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(3) The loss on settlement of convertible notes represents the difference between (i) the fair value of the consideration transferred and (ii) the sum of the carrying value of the debt at the time of repurchase for $100 million of convertible notes with an original maturity of January 15, 2025. </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(4) As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (""CARES Act""), the Company received $23.7 million from the United States Department of Health and Human Services Provider Relief Fund provided to eligible healthcare providers. The CARES Act funds are meant to offset the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic which include increases in the Company's costs and lost revenues.</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(5) During the third quarter of 2021, the Company determined that the supply agreement intangible asset recorded as part of the combination with Genomic Health was impaired due to the performance of the underlying product. As a result, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements, the Company recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment of $20.2 million. </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">During the third quarter of 2020, the Company began discussions with Biocartis regarding the termination of its agreements related to the development of an in vitro diagnostic version of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test. As a result, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements, the Company recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment loss of $200.0 million related to the in-process research and development intangible asset that was initially recorded as part of the combination with Genomic Health.</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">During the third quarter of 2020, the Company abandoned certain research and development assets acquired through an asset purchase agreement with Armune Biosciences, Inc. in 2017. These assets were expected to complement the Company's product pipeline and were expected to have alternative future uses at the time of acquisition; however, due to changes in strategic priorities and efforts during the third quarter of 2020, these assets are no longer expected to be utilized to advance the Company's product pipeline. As a result, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements, the Company concluded that the intangible asset would need to be written off as of September 30, 2020 which resulted in a non-cash, pre-tax impairment loss of $9.7 million.</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(6) During the third quarter of 2021, the Company presented a settlement offer of approximately $10 million to the United States Department of Justice (""DOJ"") concerning the DOJ's investigation of Genomic Health's compliance with the Medicare Date of Service billing regulations, which was accrued for as of September 30, 2021. This represents the Company's best estimate of the probable loss for this matter, but the recorded amount may be materially adversely affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of this matter. </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(7) Represents severance costs as a result of proactive measures the Company put in place to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The severance cost resulting from this workforce reduction was $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>EXACT SCIENCES CORPORATION</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Selected Unaudited Financial Information</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin Reconciliations</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(Amounts in thousands)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Three Months Ended September 30,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Nine Months Ended September 30,</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2021</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>2020</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Revenue</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">456,379</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">408,363</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,293,275</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1,025,052</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">115,738</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">95,061</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">339,699</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">254,559</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Amortization of acquired intangible assets <sup>(1)</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">21,214</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">20,555</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">62,957</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">61,573</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Gross profit</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">319,427</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">292,747</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">890,619</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">708,920</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Gross margin</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">70%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">72%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">69%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">69%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Amortization of acquired intangible assets <sup>(1)</sup></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">21,214</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">20,555</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">62,957</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">61,573</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Non-GAAP gross profit</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">340,641</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">313,302</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">953,576</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">$</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">770,493</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Non-GAAP gross margin</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">75%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">77%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">74%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">75%</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">____________________</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(1) Includes only amortization of intangible assets identified as developed technology assets through purchase accounting transactions, which otherwise would have been allocated to cost of sales.</span> <b>Investor Contact:<br class=""dnr""></b><span class=""xn-person"">Megan Jones</span><br class=""dnr"">Exact Sciences Corp.<br class=""dnr""><a href=""mailto:meganjones@exactsciences.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">meganjones@exactsciences.com</a><br class=""dnr"">608-535-8815 <b>Media Contact:<br class=""dnr""></b><span class=""xn-person"">Katie Boyce</span><br class=""dnr"">Exact Sciences Corp.<br class=""dnr""><a href=""mailto:kboyce@exactsciences.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kboyce@exactsciences.com</a><br class=""dnr"">608-710-3903 SOURCE Exact Sciences Corporation  <a title=""Link to http://www.exactsciences.com"" href=""http://www.exactsciences.com/"" class=""linkOnClick"" data-include="""" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.exactsciences.com</a><br> More news releases in similar topics <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:05 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">OKLAHOMA CITY</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ --&nbsp;Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:<a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chesapeake-energy-corporation-reports-2021-third-quarter-results-301414525.html#financial-modal"">CHK</a>) today reported 2021 third quarter results. Highlights include: <span class=""prnews_span"">(1)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">A Non-GAAP measure as defined in the supplemental financial tables available on the company's website at <a class=""prnews_a"" href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344663-1&amp;h=479720231&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chk.com%2F&amp;a=www.chk.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.chk.com</a>. </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(2)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">As reported under 40 CFR 98 Subpart W <br class=""dnr""></span> <span class=""xn-person"">Nick Dell</span>'Osso, Chesapeake's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""Chesapeake has built significant momentum throughout this year as our employees continue to deliver outstanding results by maintaining their focus on the execution of our strategy – maximizing sustainable cash flow through our high return drilling program, building inventory by reducing our breakeven levels in all assets and reducing operating costs. We look forward to integrating the outstanding assets in the Vine acquisition and expect our strong performance will continue into 2022. Additionally, we are very pleased to be making rapid progress on certifying 100% of our dry gas production as Responsibly Sourced Gas by mid-year 2022 as well as significantly reducing our emissions in our oil assets as we highlight the very low methane emissions profile of our modern, responsibly operated oil and gas operations.""  <b><i><u>Increase in Base Dividend; Incremental Variable Dividend Payable Beginning <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2022</span></u></i></b> During the 2021 third quarter, Chesapeake generated <span class=""xn-money"">$443 million</span> of operating cash flow and ended the quarter with <span class=""xn-money"">$849 million</span> of cash on hand. Consistent with the company's strong liquidity, free cash flow generation and its previous announcement, Chesapeake's Board of Directors increased its base quarterly dividend on its common shares to <span class=""xn-money"">$0.4375</span> per share, representing a 27% increase compared to the previous dividend amount. The base dividend will be payable on <span class=""xn-chron"">December 9, 2021</span> to shareholders of record at the close of business on <span class=""xn-chron"">November 24, 2021</span>. Additionally, Chesapeake plans to adopt a variable return program that will result in the payment of an additional dividend, payable beginning in <span class=""xn-chron"">March 2022</span>, equal to the sum of free cash flow from the prior quarter less the base quarterly dividend, multiplied by 50%.  <b><i><u>Operations Update</u></i></b> Chesapeake continues to see lower base production decline rates which helped achieve an average net production rate of approximately 436,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (approximately 80% natural gas and 20% total liquids) during the 2021 third quarter. Chesapeake is currently operating eleven rigs across all its business units, with three rigs in Appalachia, six rigs located in the Gulf Coast, one rig in the South Texas Eagle Ford Shale and one rig in the Powder River Basin. <b><i><u>ESG Program Update</u></i></b> Chesapeake intends to invest over <span class=""xn-money"">$30 million</span> on ESG initiatives by year end 2022. As part of this effort, the company anticipates retrofitting more than 19,000 pneumatic devices, primarily focused on its oil assets. The program was initiated in the 2021 third quarter, initially focusing on its Brazos Valley business unit, and once complete, is expected to reduce reported GHG emissions by approximately 40% and methane emissions by approximately 80% enterprise wide. Chesapeake continues to make progress towards certifying 100% of its Gulf Coast and Appalachia operations as Responsibly Sourced Gas primarily through the EO 100/MiQ certification process. All continuous methane emissions monitoring devices have been placed in the field in Chesapeake's legacy <span class=""xn-location"">Louisiana</span> asset and efforts are underway to install these or similar devices under Project Canary's TrustWell certification process in the newly acquired Vine acreage. Certification of both areas is expected to be completed by year-end. In <span class=""xn-location"">Pennsylvania</span>, Chesapeake anticipates completing installation of the methane monitoring devices in the 2021 fourth quarter with certification achieved by the end of the 2022 second quarter. At this point, Chesapeake expects to ultimately market approximately 3 billion cubic feet (bcf) per day of certified Responsibly Sourced Gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Chesapeake's commitment to its ESG program includes a rigorous corporate governance model that drives accountability. Recent enhancements to Chesapeake's compensation program is evidence of this accountability as the program directly limits payout, regardless of performance in other areas, should the company fail to meet critical environmental and safety metrics, including GHG intensity factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b><i><u>Updates to 2021 and Preliminary 2022 Guidance</u></i></b> Chesapeake increased its expected 2021 adjusted EBITDAX range to approximately <span class=""xn-money"">$2.1</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$2.2 billion</span>, up from <span class=""xn-money"">$1.8</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$1.9 billion</span> previously, and incorporating the earlier than expected closing of the Vine acquisition. In addition, the company increased its total annual production while maintaining its commitment to disciplined spending with no change to its previous capital program. Additionally, Chesapeake increased its preliminary 2022 adjusted EBITDAX outlook to <span class=""xn-money"">$3.2</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$3.4 billion</span>, up from <span class=""xn-money"">$2.55</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$2.75 billion</span>, with projected results largely based on recent commodity prices. The company expects to seek Board approval of its 2022 capital program later in the month and plans to provide formal 2022 guidance in early 2022. <b><i><u>Conference Call Information</u></i></b> Chesapeake will conduct a conference call to discuss these results on <span class=""xn-chron"">Wednesday, November 3, 2021</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">9:00 am EDT</span>. The telephone number to access the conference call is 888-317-6003 or 412-317-6061 for international callers. The passcode for the call is 6823443. <b><i><u>Financial Statements and Non-GAAP Financial Measures</u></i></b> The company's 2021 third quarter financial and operational results, along with non-GAAP measures that adjust for items that are typically excluded by securities analysts, are available on the company's website. Such non-GAAP measures should be not considered as an alternative to GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and other disclosures are provided with the supplemental financial tables available on the company's website at <a href=""http://www.chk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.chk.com</a>. <b><i><u>2021 Guidance and 2022 Preliminary Outlook Projections</u></i></b> Management's updated guidance for the remainder of 2021 and its preliminary updated guidance for 2022 can be found on the company's website at <a href=""http://www.chk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.chk.com</a>. <b><i><u>Fresh Start Accounting and Predecessor and Successor Periods</u></i></b> In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy on <span class=""xn-chron"">February 9, 2021</span>, Chesapeake qualified for and applied fresh start accounting. In applying fresh start accounting, Chesapeake allocated its reorganization value to its individual assets based on their estimated fair values. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements after <span class=""xn-chron"">February 9, 2021</span> are not comparable with the consolidated financial statements as of or prior to that date. References to ""Successor"" refer to the post-emergence reorganized Chesapeake after <span class=""xn-chron"">February 9, 2021</span>, and references to ""Predecessor"" refer to pre-emergence Chesapeake for periods on or before <span class=""xn-chron"">February 9, 2021</span>. <b><i>Headquartered in <span class=""xn-location"">Oklahoma City</span>, Chesapeake Energy Corporation's (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chesapeake-energy-corporation-reports-2021-third-quarter-results-301414525.html#financial-modal"">CHK</a>) operations are focused on discovering and responsibly developing its large and geographically diverse resource base of unconventional oil and natural gas assets onshore in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span>. </i></b> <b><i>Forward-Looking Statements </i></b> <i>This news release and the accompanying outlook include ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are statements other than statements of historical fact. They include statements that give our current expectations, management's outlook guidance or forecasts of future events, expected natural gas and oil growth trajectory, projected cash flow and liquidity, our ability to enhance our cash flow and financial flexibility, dividend plans, future production and commodity mix, plans and objectives for future operations, ESG initiatives, the ability of our employees, portfolio strength and operational leadership to create long-term value, and the assumptions on which such statements are based. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, they are inherently subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. No assurance can be given that such forward-looking statements will be correct or achieved or that the assumptions are accurate or will not change over time.</i> <i>Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include those described under ""Risk Factors"" in Item 1A of our annual report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in Chesapeake's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K (available at <a href=""http://www.chk.com/investors/sec-filings"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.chk.com/investors/sec-filings</a>). These risk factors include: the ability to execute on our business strategy following emergence from bankruptcy; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our business, financial condition, employees, contractors and vendors, and on the global demand for oil and natural gas and U.S. and world financial markets; risks related to the Vine Acquisition, including our ability to successfully integrate the business of Vine into the company and achieve the expected synergies from the Vine Acquisition within the expected timeframe;the volatility of oil, natural gas and NGL prices; the limitations our level of indebtedness may have on our financial flexibility; our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms; the availability of cash flows from operations and other funds to fund cash dividends, to finance reserve replacement costs or satisfy our debt obligations; write-downs of our oil and natural gas asset carrying values due to low commodity prices; our ability to replace reserves and sustain production; uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and projecting future rates of production and the amount and timing of development expenditures; our ability to generate profits or achieve targeted results in drilling and well operations; leasehold terms expiring before production can be established; commodity derivative activities resulting in lower prices realized on oil, natural gas and NGL sales; the need to secure derivative liabilities and the inability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations; adverse developments or losses from pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings, including royalty claims; charges incurred in response to market conditions; drilling and operating risks and resulting liabilities; effects of environmental protection laws and regulations on our business; legislative and regulatory initiatives further regulating hydraulic fracturing; our need to secure adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations and to dispose of or recycle the water used; impacts of potential legislative and regulatory actions addressing climate change; federal and state tax proposals affecting our industry; potential OTC derivatives regulation limiting our ability to hedge against commodity price fluctuations; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry; a deterioration in general economic, business or industry conditions; negative public perceptions of our industry; limited control over properties we do not operate; pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and transportation interruptions; terrorist activities and cyber-attacks adversely impacting our operations; and an interruption in operations at our headquarters due to a catastrophic event.</i> <i>In addition, disclosures concerning the estimated contribution of derivative contracts to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. Our production forecasts are also dependent upon many assumptions, including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the outcome of future drilling activity. We caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date of this news release, and we undertake no obligation to update any of the information provided in this release, except as required by applicable law.

The primary outcome measure is 90-day survival rate for patients treated with larsucosterol compared to those treated with placebo plus SOC.&nbsp; The Company is targeting more than 60 clinical trial sites across the U.S., E.U., U.K., and <span class=""xn-location"">Australia</span>. Reflecting the life-threatening nature of AH and the lack of therapeutic options for this devastating condition, the FDA has granted&nbsp;larsucosterol Fast Track Designation for the treatment of AH.&nbsp; We believe demonstration of a robust survival benefit in the AHFIRM trial would support an NDA filing. <b>About DURECT Corporation<br class=""dnr""></b>DURECT&nbsp;is a biopharmaceutical company committed to transforming the treatment of acute organ injury and chronic liver diseases by advancing novel and potentially lifesaving therapies based on its endogenous epigenetic regulator program. Larsucosterol (also known as DUR-928), the Company's lead drug candidate, binds to and inhibits the activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), epigenetic enzymes which are elevated and associated with hypermethylation found in AH patients. <i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;Larsucosterol is in clinical development for the potential treatment of alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) for which FDA has granted a Fast Track Designation; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is also being explored.&nbsp;In addition, POSIMIR<sup>®</sup> (bupivacaine solution) for infiltration use, a non-opioid analgesic utilizing the innovative SABER® platform technology,&nbsp;is FDA-approved.

Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks that the AHFIRM trial takes longer to conduct than anticipated due to COVID-19 or other factors, the risk that ongoing and future clinical trials of larsucosterol&nbsp;do not confirm the results from earlier clinical or pre-clinical trials, or do not demonstrate the safety or efficacy or the life-saving potential of larsucosterol&nbsp;in a statistically significant manner, the risk that the AHFIRM trial, even if successful, may not be sufficient alone to support an NDA filing for larsucosterol in AH, the risk that Fast Track designation for larsucosterol&nbsp;in AH may not actually lead to faster FDA review or an approval, risks that biomarker data in earlier trials of larsucosterol&nbsp;may not predict clinical efficacy, risks that we may not enter a commercial license for POSIMIR on favorable terms, if at all, risks that a licensee may not commercialize POSIMIR successfully, if at all, and risks related to entering into new agreements or our ability to obtain capital to fund operations and expenses.&nbsp; Further information regarding these and other risks is included in DURECT's Form 10-K filed on <span class=""xn-chron"">March 5, 2021</span> and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span> when filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission&nbsp;under the heading ""Risk Factors.""

""Access to better mental health services, across the board, is valued now more than ever and it's important that youth are not only not left behind, but are a critical focus,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Erik Osland</span>, Managing Partner of evolvedMD. ""We've piloted a program with <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344791-1&amp;h=1005495311&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.grangermedical.com%2F&amp;a=Granger+Medical+Clinic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Granger Medical Clinic</a> at their Fairbourne Station location in <span class=""xn-location"">Utah</span>, successfully, and will continue to expand pediatric behavioral health services at additional practices in <span class=""xn-location"">Utah</span>, <span class=""xn-location"">Arizona</span>, and nationwide."" According to the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), more than 20% of U.S. children struggle with a mental health condition, but only half receive appropriate treatment. Granger and evolvedMD are working to change that.&nbsp;At a time when <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3344791-1&amp;h=2767852546&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjamapediatrics%2Farticle-abstract%2F2735637&amp;a=Utah+ranks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""xn-location"">Utah</span> ranks</a> among a group of states as having the highest prevalence of mental health disorders in youth age 6-17 as well as youth with untreated mental health needs, the integrated pediatric behavioral health program will enable families to get much-needed treatment in the same building as their pediatrician.  ""Stigma and limited availability are just some of the barriers to receiving quality behavioral health services within the younger population,"" said Granger pediatrician, Dr. <span class=""xn-person"">Reed Evers</span>. ""Each year, four million children in the U.S. are diagnosed with anxiety and another two million with depression. Imagine the population we're not reaching and that go untreated each year? It all can start with a conversation, within the trusted walls of a primary care physician's office.""

Adjustments to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other items are presented on the attached reconciliations. For comparability of results to the prior year, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS amounts for 2020 have been revised to reflect the update to our non-GAAP policy that excludes gains and losses on certain equity investments. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for further discussion.</i> <b>Product Sales Performance</b> Total product sales increased 4% for the third quarter of 2021 versus the third quarter of 2020. Unit volumes grew 8% while net selling price declined 7%. In addition, this quarter includes <span class=""xn-money"">$147 million</span> of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions related to prior periods. In the third quarter last year, the favorable estimated sales deductions were <span class=""xn-money"">$36 million</span>, resulting in a <span class=""xn-money"">$111 million</span> year-over-year benefit in this quarter. We continue to see gradual recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we progressed through the third quarter, we saw improvement in patient visits and diagnoses. Healthcare professional activity also improved during the first half of 2021 and stabilized during the third quarter. Overall, the gap in diagnosis visits over the course of the pandemic has suppressed the number of new patients starting treatment, which we expect will continue to impact our business for the remainder of the year. <b><i>General Medicine</i></b> <b><i>Inflammation</i></b> <b><i>Hematology-Oncology</i></b> <b><i>Established Products</i></b> <b>Product Sales Detail by Product and Geographic

accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and on a non-GAAP basis. In addition, management has presented its full year 2021 EPS and tax rate guidance in accordance with GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain items related to acquisitions, restructuring and certain other items from the related GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the news release. Management has also presented Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the third quarters of 2021 and 2020. FCF is computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, each as determined in accordance with GAAP.  The Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor's overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of the Company's ongoing business activities by facilitating comparisons of results of ongoing business operations among current, past and future periods. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company's liquidity. Beginning <span class=""xn-chron"">January 1, 2021</span>, we began to exclude the gains and losses on our investments in equity securities from our non-GAAP measures that are recorded to Other income (expense). This exclusion will not apply to our share of the earnings and losses of our strategic investments in corporations accounted for under the equity method of accounting, such as our investment in BeiGene. The Company will be excluding gains and losses from equity investments for the purpose of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented because the Company believes the results of such gains and losses are not representative of our normal business operations. We are making this change beginning in 2021 because, as we have increased our investments in these companies, we recognized that the resulting variability can impede comparability between periods of our financial performance for our ongoing business operations. For comparability of results to the prior year, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS amounts for 2020 have been revised to reflect the update to our non-GAAP policy that excludes gains and losses on certain equity investments.  The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures set forth in the news release in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets. The non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. <b>About Amgen<br class=""dnr""></b>Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla<sup>®</sup> (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, or the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in <span class=""xn-location"">Puerto Rico</span>, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.

pursuant to an update to our non-GAAP policy. For comparability of results to the prior year, non-GAAP Other income, net, non-GAAP Net income and non-GAAP EPS amounts for 2020 have been revised to reflect the update to our non-GAAP policy. </span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(a)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">The adjustments related primarily to noncash amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions.</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(b)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">The adjustments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, related primarily to licensing-related expense from the upfront payment to Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. and noncash amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions.&nbsp; The adjustments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, related primarily to noncash amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions.</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(c)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the adjustments related primarily to the change in fair values of contingent consideration liabilities.

Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including the majority of amortization of intangible assets, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring initiatives, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. Acquired IPR&amp;D expense from the Five Prime acquisition was not tax deductible. Due to these factors, the effective tax rates for the adjustments to our GAAP income before income taxes, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, were 12.7% and 13.5%, compared to 20.7% and 19.9% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>(e)</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">The adjustments related to certain acquisition items,

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:01 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">SANTA FE, N.M.</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Thornburg Income Builder Opportunities Trust (the ""Trust"") (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thornburg-income-builder-opportunities-trust-announces-distribution-301414603.html#financial-modal"">TBLD</a>) today announced a monthly distribution of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.10417</span> per share on the Trust's common shares, payable on <span class=""xn-chron"">November 22, 2021</span> to common shareholders of record as of <span class=""xn-chron"">November 15, 2021</span>.  The Trust's monthly distributions are shown below: <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Amount</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Payable Date</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Ex-Dividend Date</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Record Date</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Change from Previous <br class=""dnr"">Declaration</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>$0.10417</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">November 22, 2021</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">November 12, 2021</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">November 15, 2021</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">No Change</span> Distribution rates are not performance and are calculated by summing the Trust's monthly distribution per share over four quarters and dividing by the net asset value or market price per share, as applicable, as of the distribution announcement date. Distributions on common shares are generally paid from net investment income (regular interest and dividends) and may also include capital gains and/or a return of capital. The Trust's distribution payable on <span class=""xn-chron"">November 22, 2021</span> does not include a return of capital but includes short term capital gains in the amount of <span class=""xn-money"">$0.10213</span>. The specific tax characteristics of the distributions will be reported to the Trust's common shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the 2021 calendar year. The Trust's inception date is <span class=""xn-chron"">July 27, 2021</span> and it has not yet made any reports on Form 1099. Shareholders should not assume that the source of a distribution from the Trust is net income or profit. A distribution comprised in whole or in part by a return of capital does not necessarily reflect the Trust's investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income."" Future distributions may consist of a return of capital. For further information regarding the Trust's distributions, please visit <a href=""https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3342923-1&amp;h=1430547057&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thornburg.com%2Ftbld-distributions&amp;a=www.thornburg.com%2Ftbld-distributions"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thornburg.com/tbld-distributions</a>. The Trust's investment objective is to provide current income and additional total return. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of its managed assets in a broad range of income-producing securities. The Trust invests in both equity and debt securities of companies located in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States</span> and around the globe. The Trust may invest in non-U.S. domiciled companies, including up to 20% of its managed assets at the time of investment in equity and debt securities of emerging market companies. As a registered investment company, the Trust is subject to a 4% excise tax that is imposed if the Trust does not distribute to common shareholders by the end of any calendar year at least the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gain or loss) for the calendar year and (ii) 98.2% of its capital gain in excess of its capital loss (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on <span class=""xn-chron"">October 31</span> of the calendar year (unless an election is made to use the Trust's fiscal year). In certain circumstances, the Trust may elect to retain income or capital gain to the extent that the Board of Trustees, in consultation with Trust management, determines it to be in the interest of shareholders to do so. The common share distributions paid by the Trust for any particular period may be more than the amount of net investment income from that period. As a result, all or a portion of a distribution may be a return of capital, which is in effect a partial return of the amount a common shareholder invested in the Trust, up to the amount of the common shareholder's tax basis in their common shares, which would reduce such tax basis. Although a return of capital may not be taxable, it will generally increase the common shareholder's potential gain, or reduce the common shareholder's potential loss, on any subsequent sale or other disposition of common shares. <b><u>About Thornburg</u></b> Founded in 1982, Thornburg Investment Management is a privately owned global investment firm that offers a range of multi-strategy solutions for institutions and financial advisors.

""We also maintained EBITDA profitability while investing heavily into the business. &nbsp;We believe these investments are foundational and that they will be resilient for several years which will spring load our growth and operating leverage over the long run."" ""We are very proud of the work of our international sourcing&nbsp;and supply chain team.&nbsp; In a challenging environment, we were able to grow inventory to record levels. Given our proven track record of sourcing, strong inventory position, and distribution center expansions, we believe we are both able and ready to serve our customers through 2021 and 2022."" <b>Third Quarter </b><b>2021</b><b> Financial Results</b> Net sales in the third quarter of 2021&nbsp;were <span class=""xn-money"">$141</span>.8&nbsp;million compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$117</span>.4&nbsp;million in the year-ago quarter.&nbsp;The increase was primarily driven by&nbsp;continued strong demand and the&nbsp;expanded&nbsp;capacity from our&nbsp;Grand Prairie distribution center (""DC""). Gross profit in the third quarter increased&nbsp;10% to <span class=""xn-money"">$47</span>.3&nbsp;million compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$43</span>.1&nbsp;million in the third quarter last year, with gross margin of&nbsp;33.4%. Total operating expenses in the third quarter were <span class=""xn-money"">$51</span>.7&nbsp;million compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$41.4 million</span> in the third quarter last year due to an increase in sales and investments in the business. Net loss in the third quarter&nbsp;was&nbsp;($4.7) million compared to&nbsp;net income of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.4 million</span> in the third quarter last year. The net loss was driven primarily by an increase in non-cash charges. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter decreased to <span class=""xn-money"">$2</span>.3&nbsp;million compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$5</span>.1&nbsp;million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven primarily from foundational investments in technology, supply chain, and category management.

Utilizing the latest technologies and design principles, we've created an easy-to-use, mobile-friendly shopping experience that, alongside our own nationwide distribution network, cuts out the brick-and-mortar supply chain costs and provides quality parts at a budget-friendly price. CarParts.com is headquartered in <span class=""xn-location"">Torrance, California</span>. <b>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b> Regulation G, and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We provide ""Adjusted EBITDA,"" which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA consists of net (loss) income before (a)&nbsp;interest expense, net; (b)&nbsp;income tax provision; (c)&nbsp;depreciation and amortization expense; (d)&nbsp;amortization of intangible assets;&nbsp;and (e)&nbsp;share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income is provided below. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides important supplemental information to management and investors. This non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and results of operations. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as one measure of the Company's operating performance because it assists in comparing the Company's operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of stock compensation expense and the costs associated with the customs issue, as well as other items that we do not believe are representative of our ongoing operating performance. Internally, this non-GAAP measure is also used by management for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; for allocating resources to enhance financial performance; and for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the ongoing operations of companies in our industry. This non-GAAP financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. In addition, the Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from the Company's non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are all unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. <b>Safe Harbor Statement</b> <i>This press release contains statements </i><i>which are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company's business and its industry, as well as certain assumptions made by the Company. These statements are forward looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provided by Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Section&nbsp;27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

""Rigel has expanded the commercial organization and our pipeline candidates are advancing in the clinic, setting us up for a transformative year in 2022,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Raul Rodriguez</span>, Rigel's president and CEO. &nbsp;""We recently achieved an important development milestone, completing enrollment of our pivotal FORWARD study in wAIHA, with an anticipated data readout in mid-2022. In addition, our sales force expansion is now complete, allowing us to have a greater impact in driving awareness and uptake for TAVALISSE as a novel, targeted therapy for ITP in the U.S."" ""We recently achieved an important development milestone, completing enrollment of our pivotal FORWARD study in wAIHA."" <b><u>Business Update</u></b> <b><u>Financial Update <br class=""dnr""></u></b>For the third quarter of 2021, Rigel reported a net loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$21.0 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.12</span> per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$14.2 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.08</span> per basic and diluted share, for the same period of 2020. In the third quarter of 2021, total revenues were <span class=""xn-money"">$21.5 million</span>, consisting of <span class=""xn-money"">$16.0 million</span> in TAVALISSE net product sales, <span class=""xn-money"">$4.5 million</span> in contract revenues from collaborations, and <span class=""xn-money"">$1.0 million</span> in government contract revenue. TAVALISSE net product sales of <span class=""xn-money"">$16.0 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021 decreased by 2% from <span class=""xn-money"">$16.3 million</span> for the same period in 2020.  Contract revenues of <span class=""xn-money"">$4.5 million</span> from collaborations for the third quarter of 2021 consisted of <span class=""xn-money"">$2.4 million</span> in revenue related to the achievement of the remaining performance obligations in Rigel's license agreement with Eli Lilly (Lilly), <span class=""xn-money"">$1.8 million</span> in revenue related to the achievement of a certain milestone from Daiichi Sankyo (Daiichi), <span class=""xn-money"">$0.2 million</span> in revenue related to the performance of certain research and development services pursuant to its collaboration agreement with Grifols, and a <span class=""xn-money"">$0.1 million</span> milestone payment from Medison. Government contract revenue of <span class=""xn-money"">$1.0 million</span> for the third quarter of 2021 was related to the income recognized pursuant to the agreement Rigel entered in <span class=""xn-chron"">January 2021</span> with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to support Rigel's ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of fostamatinib in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Rigel reported total costs and expenses of <span class=""xn-money"">$41.3 million</span> in the third quarter of 2021, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$32.2 million</span> for the same period in 2020. The increase in costs and expenses was primarily due to the research and development costs related to Rigel's ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of fostamatinib for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, as well as increased commercial activities, including the recent sales force expansion.  For the nine months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, Rigel reported net income of <span class=""xn-money"">$4.7 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.03</span> per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of <span class=""xn-money"">$10.5 million</span>, or <span class=""xn-money"">$0.06</span> per basic and diluted share, for the same period of 2020. Rigel reported total revenues of <span class=""xn-money"">$128.8 million</span> for the nine months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, consisting of <span class=""xn-money"">$45.4 million</span> in TAVALISSE net product sales, <span class=""xn-money"">$73.9 million</span> in contract revenues from collaborations, and <span class=""xn-money"">$9.5 million</span> in government contract revenues. TAVALISSE net product sales of <span class=""xn-money"">$45.4 million</span> increased by 3% from <span class=""xn-money"">$43.9 million</span> for the same period of 2020.  Total costs and expenses for the nine months ended <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, were <span class=""xn-money"">$119.9 million</span>, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$100.3 million</span> for the same period in 2020. The increase in costs and expenses was primarily due to increases in research and development costs related to Rigel's various ongoing clinical studies, including its Phase 3 clinical trial of fostamatinib for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, increased commercial activities that include the recent sales force expansion, personnel-related costs, and stock-based compensation expense. As of <span class=""xn-chron"">September 30, 2021</span>, Rigel had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of <span class=""xn-money"">$143.1 million</span>, compared to <span class=""xn-money"">$57.3 million</span> as of <span class=""xn-chron"">December 31, 2020</span>.  <b><u>Conference Call and Webcast with Slides Today at <span class=""xn-chron"">4:30pm Eastern Time</span><br class=""dnr""></u></b>Rigel will hold a live conference call and webcast today at <span class=""xn-chron"">4:30pm Eastern Time</span> (<span class=""xn-chron"">1:30pm Pacific Time</span>).

The webcast will be archived and available for replay after the call via the Rigel website. <b><u>About ITP<br class=""dnr""></u></b>In patients with ITP (immune thrombocytopenia), the immune system attacks and destroys the body's own blood platelets, which play an active role in blood clotting and healing. Common symptoms of ITP are excessive bruising and bleeding. People suffering with chronic ITP may live with an increased risk of severe bleeding events that can result in serious medical complications or even death. Current therapies for ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters (TPO-RAs), and splenectomy. However, not all patients respond to existing therapies. As a result, there remains a significant medical need for additional treatment options for patients with ITP. <b><u>About AIHA<br class=""dnr""></u></b>Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare, serious blood disorder in which the immune system produces antibodies that destroy the body's own red blood cells. AIHA affects approximately 45,000 adult patients in the U.S. and can be a severe, debilitating disease. To date, there are no disease-targeted therapies approved for AIHA, despite the unmet medical need that exists for these patients. Warm antibody AIHA (wAIHA), the most common form of AIHA, is characterized by the presence of antibodies that react with the red blood cell surface at body temperature. <b><u>About COVID-19 &amp; SYK Inhibition<br class=""dnr""></u></b>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the upper and lower respiratory tract and can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, some patients develop other organ dysfunction including myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, shock resulting in endothelial dysfunction and subsequently micro and macrovascular thrombosis.<sup>1</sup> Much of the underlying pathology of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be secondary to a hyperinflammatory immune response associated with increased risk of thrombosis.<sup>2</sup> SYK is involved in the intracellular signaling pathways of many different immune cells. Therefore, SYK inhibition may improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 via inhibition of key Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) and c-type lectin receptor (CLR) mediated drivers of pathology such as pro-inflammatory cytokine release by monocytes and macrophages, production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by neutrophils, and platelet aggregation.<sup>3,4,5,6</sup> Furthermore, SYK inhibition in neutrophils and platelets may lead to decreased thrombo-inflammation, alleviating organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:01 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">MINNEAPOLIS</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Bio-Techne Corporation (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bio-techne-named-in-incs-first-annual-best-led-companies-301414427.html#financial-modal"">TECH</a>) today announced inclusion in <i>Inc.</i>'s first annual Best-Led Companies list, an exciting 12-point measure of management excellence across the middle market — a select, data-driven list of the very strongest U.S. firms with revenue of <span class=""xn-money"">$50 million</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$2 billion</span>. This novel program is the first <i>Inc.</i> recognition list to honor both public and private companies. The final list recognizes 250 companies that are agile enough to maneuver but also large enough to have a broad impact. These companies employ 35 million people, about one in four U.S. workers. All 250 have a successful track record with leadership teams that spur solid performance, create value, penetrate markets, engage with customers, and more. To be considered for the list, each company had to fill out an application answering questions about its performance, executive team, and leadership. Applicants were then analyzed via an algorithm that identified the very best companies according to their leadership teams' superlative accomplishments in four key areas: performance and value creation; market penetration and customer engagement; talent; and leadership team. ""We are honored to be recognized in <i>Inc.</i>'s inaugural list of Best-Led Companies,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Chuck Kummeth</span>, Bio-Techne's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""This achievement reflects strong leadership at all levels of Bio-Techne. This leadership has been an integral part of our recent strong performance and positions the Company for continued growth going forward."" ""This inaugural list of companies represents the remarkable midsized companies, both public and private, often founder-led, that are at the vanguard of reinventing American business,"" says <span class=""xn-person"">Scott Omelianuk</span>, editor-in-chief of <i>Inc.</i> magazine. ""With their leadership, all business will benefit from an exciting, competitive future full of possibilities."" To compile the list, <i>Inc. </i>evaluated private and public U.S.-based companies with a 2020 revenue of <span class=""xn-money"">$50 million</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$2 billion</span> or a valuation of <span class=""xn-money"">$50 million</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$10 billion</span> using a proprietary 12-point measure of management excellence, generated with input from partners at Pitchbook and <span class=""xn-person"">Shango Labs</span>.

The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Company's management based upon the evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Repurchases will be executed in the open market subject to Rule <span class=""xn-money"">10b</span>-18, and may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit the Company to repurchase shares when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. Other structured repurchase programs may be considered from time to time. The Company may choose to suspend, expand or discontinue the repurchase program at any time. <span class=""prnews_span"">*</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for definitions</span> <b>Quarterly Conference Call<br class=""dnr""></b>Akamai will host a conference call today at <span class=""xn-chron"">4:30 p.m. ET</span> that can be accessed through 1-844-578-9671 (or 1-508-637-5655 for international calls) and using passcode 1956828.

Measures</b> In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in <span class=""xn-location"">the United States of America</span> (GAAP), Akamai provides additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP (non-GAAP). Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation and to evaluate Akamai's financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, capital expenditures and impact of foreign currency exchange rates, as discussed below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Akamai's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as they facilitate comparison of financial results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate Akamai's operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. These non-GAAP financial measures may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of Akamai's ongoing operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of Akamai's GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, Akamai's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Akamai has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in its financial reporting and investor presentations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This reconciliation captioned ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" can be found on the Investor Relations section of Akamai's website. The non-GAAP adjustments, and Akamai's basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below: Akamai's definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures are outlined below:  <b>Non-GAAP income from operations </b>–&nbsp;GAAP income from operations adjusted for the following items: amortization of acquired intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized interest expense; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; gains and losses on legal settlements; costs incurred related to endowments to the Akamai Foundation; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.&nbsp; <b>Non-GAAP operating margin</b>&nbsp;– Non-GAAP income from operations stated as a percentage of revenue.  <b>Non-GAAP net income </b>–&nbsp;GAAP net income adjusted for the following tax-affected items: amortization of acquired intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; gains and losses on legal settlements; costs incurred related to endowments to the Akamai Foundation; amortization of debt discount and issuance costs; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; income and losses from equity method investment; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.&nbsp; <b>Non-GAAP net income per diluted share </b>– Non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding are adjusted in non-GAAP per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to Akamai pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuances of <span class=""xn-money"">$1,150 million</span> of convertible senior notes due 2027 and 2025, respectively. Under GAAP, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. However, the company would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of operating performance. With respect to the convertible senior notes due in each of 2027 and 2025, unless Akamai's weighted average stock price is greater than <span class=""xn-money"">$116.18</span> and <span class=""xn-money"">$95.10</span>, respectively, the initial conversion price, there will be no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.  <b>Adjusted EBITDA </b>– GAAP net income excluding the following items: interest income; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; gains and losses on legal settlements; costs incurred related to endowments to the Akamai Foundation; foreign exchange gains and losses; interest expense; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; income and losses on equity method investment; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.  <b>Adjusted EBITDA margin </b>– Adjusted EBITDA stated as a percentage of revenue.  <b>Capital expenditures, or capex, excluding stock-based compensation and interest expense</b>&nbsp;– Purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software development costs presented on an accrual basis, which differs from the cash-basis presentation included in the statements of cash flows. The primary difference between the two is the change in purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software development costs accrued for, but not paid, at period end versus prior periods.  <b>Impact of foreign currency exchange rate</b>&nbsp;– Revenue and earnings from international operations have historically been an important contributor to Akamai's financial results. Consequently, Akamai's financial results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken, our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted. Because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. The dollar impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount. The percentage change at constant currency presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period.  <b>Akamai Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act<br class=""dnr""></b>This release and/or our quarterly earnings conference call scheduled for later today contain information about future expectations, plans and prospects of Akamai's management that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about expected future financial performance. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including, but not limited to, inability to continue to generate cash at the same level as prior years; failure to realize the expected benefits from our announced reorganization; failure of our investments in innovation to generate solutions that are accepted in the market; inability to increase our revenue at the same rate as in the past and keep our expenses from increasing at a greater rate than our revenues; impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; defects or disruptions in our products or IT systems; failure of the integration of any of our acquisitions; delay in developing or failure to develop new service offerings or functionalities, and if developed, lack of market acceptance of such service offerings and functionalities or failure of such solutions to operate as expected, and other factors that are discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other documents periodically filed with the SEC. In addition, the statements in this press release and on such call represent Akamai's expectations and beliefs as of the date of this press release. Akamai anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause these expectations and beliefs to change. However, while Akamai may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Akamai's expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.

We expect further debt reduction to come from strong operating cash flows and expected asset sale proceeds,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Bret Yunker</span>, Chief Financial Officer.  <b>Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures</b> Adjusted EBITDA (described below), a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding our ongoing operating results. Management has historically used Adjusted EBITDA when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest income or interest expense, net of interest capitalized, (benefit) provision for income taxes, unrealized (gain) loss on investments and marketable securities, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, impairment charges, transaction expenses, severance expense, selling costs associated with the divestitures of properties, equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates, (gain) loss on the sale or disposal of property and equipment, (gain) loss related to divestitures, changes in the fair value of certain derivatives and certain non-recurring expenses such as sign-on and retention bonuses, business optimization expenses and transformation expenses, certain litigation awards and settlements, losses on inventory associated with properties temporarily closed as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency, contract exit or termination costs, and certain regulatory settlements. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the expense associated with certain of our leases as these transactions were accounted for as financing obligations and the associated expense is included in interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. It is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. Uses of cash flows that are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments, payments under our leases with affiliates of GLPI and VICI Properties, Inc. and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements. <b>Conference Call Information</b> The Company will host a conference call to discuss the Company's results on <span class=""xn-chron"">November 2, 2021</span> at <span class=""xn-chron"">2 p.m. Pacific Time</span>.

The Company reports Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company calculates Non-GAAP net income and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of debt discount, debt extinguishment expense and certain adjustments to income tax expense. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures are included at the end of this press release.&nbsp; The Company evaluates other items of income and expense on an individual basis and considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including (i) its size and nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to the Company's ongoing business operations and (iii) whether or not the Company expects it to occur as part of Halozyme's normal business on a regular basis. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. These Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.&nbsp; In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that the Company may exclude for purposes of its Non-GAAP financial measures; and the Company may in the future cease to exclude items that it has historically excluded for purposes of its Non-GAAP financial measures. Halozyme considers these Non-GAAP financial measures to be important because they provide useful measures of the operating performance of the Company, exclusive of factors that do not directly affect what the Company considers to be its core operating performance, as well as unusual events. The Non-GAAP measures also allow investors and analysts to make additional comparisons of the operating activities of the Company's core business over time and with respect to other companies, as well as assessing trends and future expectations. <b>Safe Harbor Statement</b> In addition to historical information, the statements set forth in this press release include forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements concerning the Company's expected future financial performance (including the Company's financial outlook for 2021) and expectations for future growth, profitability, revenue, operating income, cash flow, expenses and earnings-per-share. Forward-looking statements regarding the Company's ENHANZE<sup>®</sup> drug delivery technology may include the possible activity, benefits and attributes of ENHANZE<sup>®</sup>, the possible method of action of ENHANZE<sup>®</sup>, its potential application to aid in the dispersion and absorption of other injected therapeutic drugs and facilitating more rapid delivery and administration of larger volumes of injectable medications through subcutaneous delivery. Forward-looking statements regarding the Company's ENHANZE<sup>® </sup>business may include potential growth and receipt of royalty and milestone payments driven by our partners' development and commercialization efforts, potential new clinical trial study starts, the size and growth prospects of our partners' drug franchises, potential new ENHANZE<sup>® </sup>collaborations and collaborative targets and regulatory review and potential approvals of new ENHANZE<sup>® </sup>products. These forward-looking statements are typically, but not always, identified through use of the words ""believe,"" ""enable,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""could,"" ""intends,"" ""estimate,"" ""anticipate,"" ""plan,"" ""predict,"" ""probable,"" ""potential,"" ""possible,"" ""should,"" ""continue,"" and other words of similar meaning and involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from the expectations contained in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including unexpected levels of revenues, expenditures and costs, unexpected results or delays in the growth of the Company's ENHANZE<sup>®</sup> business, or in the development, regulatory review or commercialization of ENHANZE<sup>®</sup> products, including any potential delays caused by the current COVID-19 global pandemic, regulatory approval requirements, unexpected adverse events or patient outcomes and competitive conditions. These and other factors that may result in differences are discussed in greater detail in the Company's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. <b>Contact:<br class=""dnr""></b><span class=""xn-person"">Al Kildani</span><br class=""dnr"">Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications<br class=""dnr"">858-704-8122<br class=""dnr""><u><a href=""mailto:ir@halozyme.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ir@halozyme.com</a> </u> <b>Footnotes:</b> <span class=""prnews_span"">1.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:01 ET Share this article <span class=""xn-location"">MINNEAPOLIS</span>, <span class=""xn-chron"">Nov. 2, 2021</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Bio-Techne Corporation (NASDAQ: <a class=""ticket-symbol"" data-toggle=""modal"" href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bio-techne-named-in-incs-first-annual-best-led-companies-301414427.html#financial-modal"">TECH</a>) today announced inclusion in <i>Inc.</i>'s first annual Best-Led Companies list, an exciting 12-point measure of management excellence across the middle market — a select, data-driven list of the very strongest U.S. firms with revenue of <span class=""xn-money"">$50 million</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$2 billion</span>. This novel program is the first <i>Inc.</i> recognition list to honor both public and private companies. The final list recognizes 250 companies that are agile enough to maneuver but also large enough to have a broad impact. These companies employ 35 million people, about one in four U.S. workers. All 250 have a successful track record with leadership teams that spur solid performance, create value, penetrate markets, engage with customers, and more. To be considered for the list, each company had to fill out an application answering questions about its performance, executive team, and leadership. Applicants were then analyzed via an algorithm that identified the very best companies according to their leadership teams' superlative accomplishments in four key areas: performance and value creation; market penetration and customer engagement; talent; and leadership team. ""We are honored to be recognized in <i>Inc.</i>'s inaugural list of Best-Led Companies,"" said <span class=""xn-person"">Chuck Kummeth</span>, Bio-Techne's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""This achievement reflects strong leadership at all levels of Bio-Techne. This leadership has been an integral part of our recent strong performance and positions the Company for continued growth going forward."" ""This inaugural list of companies represents the remarkable midsized companies, both public and private, often founder-led, that are at the vanguard of reinventing American business,"" says <span class=""xn-person"">Scott Omelianuk</span>, editor-in-chief of <i>Inc.</i> magazine. ""With their leadership, all business will benefit from an exciting, competitive future full of possibilities."" To compile the list, <i>Inc. </i>evaluated private and public U.S.-based companies with a 2020 revenue of <span class=""xn-money"">$50 million</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$2 billion</span> or a valuation of <span class=""xn-money"">$50 million</span> to <span class=""xn-money"">$10 billion</span> using a proprietary 12-point measure of management excellence, generated with input from partners at Pitchbook and <span class=""xn-person"">Shango Labs</span>.

From the factory, the model marries a race-bred 472-hp 5.0-liter V8 with the thoughtfully executed sedan details people have come to expect from Lexus. For the 2021 SEMA Show, Lexus partnered with Hiraku Co. and Lexus ambassador, Townsend Bell, to develop a uniquely appealing street performance themed IS 500 build.  <b>STYLING</b> The IS 500's athletic lines serve up the perfect canvas for an exterior treatment that adds presence in the form of a one-off 3D printed body kit. Designed by Hiraku Co., the kit involves a front lip spoiler, side steps, rear diffuser, front fenders, bumper canards, rear roof spoiler and rear bumper garnish, complemented by a Seibon carbon fiber hood and trunk. The body is then covered in a subtly retina-piercing vinyl body wrap that offers a modern take on the traditional Lexus spindle styling cues.  <b>PERFORMANCE</b> This IS 500's street performance envelope is expanded with a few tasteful modifications to enhance the V8's breathing. On the induction side, sits a custom A'PEXi induction box with a TOMS Racing Carbon Fiber suction pipe. Spent fumes exit through an A'PEXi N1 Evolution Extreme Quad Ti-tip exhaust system that puts the 2UR-GSE V8's melody on blast.  Enhanced and more sudden throttle control is also part of the mix thanks to the addition of a Shiftpower 4.0 App-controlled throttle control by <span class=""xn-person"">Beat Soni</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b>HANDLING</b> The sport sedan's chassis has been stiffened for better reflexes with the help of TOMS chassis braces over the front and rear suspension. An A'PEXi N1 EXV 32-way adjustable coilover system helps keep the car planted. Rotiform LAS-R wheels with one-of-a-kind aerodisc covers add a sense of retro-modern styling. These extra-wide 20-inch wheels are wrapped in Nitto Invo rubber along with a Brembo GT braking system with custom-painted calipers to help provide the necessary stopping power.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b>BUILD BOX HIRAKU CO./TOWNSEND BELL STREET PERFORMANCE IS 500 </b> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Exterior</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Seibon Carbon fiber hood</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Seibon Carbon fiber trunk</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Hiarku front lip spoiler</span> &nbsp; <span class=""prnews_span"">Hiraku front fenders</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">All components are 3D printed in house</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Hiraku Side step</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Hiraku front canards</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Hiraku rear roof spoiler</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Hiraku rear spoiler</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Kiraku rear bumper garnish</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Custom body wrap</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Wraptialian/Orafoll Americas</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Matte white body wrap with teal accents and a glossy white spindle grille design pattern</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Chassis</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">TOMS front and rear chassis braces</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">A'PEXi N1 32-way adjustable coilovers</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Brakes</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Brembo GT system front and rear</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Custom painted calipers </span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Sound and motion</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">A'PEXi N1 Evolution Extreme Quad Ti-Tip Exhaust system</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">A'PEXi custom induction box</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">TOMS racing Carbon fiber suction pipe</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Shiftpower 4.0 app controlled Throttle control by Beat Soni</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Wheels</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Front 20x9 inch</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Rotiform LAS-R&nbsp;&nbsp; +Aerodisc (anthracite)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Rear 20x10.5 inch</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Rotiform LAS-R +</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">aerodisc</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">(anthracite)</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Tires</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Front</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">245/35-20 Nitto Invo</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Rear</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">275/30-20 Nitto Invo</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Interior</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Sparco SPX carbon fiber reclining seats</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Custom alcantara steering wheel</span> DSPORT &amp; SCOTT PRUETT TRACK PERFORMANCE IS 350  The 2021 Lexus IS 350 F SPORT sits just below the IS 500 on the brand's F SPORT Performance ladder. From the factory, this level of Lexus' performance sedan features improved handling thanks to its Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) system and an available limited slip differential. Recognizing the potential of this recently refreshed IS platform, Lexus teamed DSPORT Magazine with legendary road racer, <span class=""xn-person"">Scott Pruett</span>, to collaborate on a first phase of longer-term mission to turn this IS 350 into a track weapon unlike any IS prior.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For SEMA 2021, reflecting the supply-chain challenges confronting major build elements such as powertrain, this IS 350 is presented as a ""reverse-build"" with a focus on the exterior, the suspension and some interior modifications. For SEMA 2022, the project will be fully developed with more than double its current level of horsepower and track-speed enhancements shared through the DSPORT editorial. Currently, this project remains powered by a spirited 311 horsepower 3.5 liter naturally aspirated V6 that imbues the sedan with spirited performance.&nbsp;  With a suitably loud splash of color, the exterior treatment pays homage to Lexus brand ambassador and Motorsports hall-of-famer, <span class=""xn-person"">Scott Pruett</span>. A unique design was developed for the wrap by Troy Lee Design using cues and colors from Pruett's helmet art. <span class=""xn-person"">Troy Lee</span> and <span class=""xn-person"">Scott Pruett</span> share a long history over Scott's decades of racing. This vinyl was expertly applied by Boss Wraps of <span class=""xn-location"">Fountain Valley Ca.</span> over a body kit sourced from <span class=""xn-location"">Japan's</span> Artisan Spirits.  SEMA <span class=""xn-money"">2021 marks</span> the global debut Artisan Spirits' hand-laid body kit that adds attitude and the width necessary to accommodate the rubber necessary for this IS to fulfill its future track mission. The kit is distinguished by its superior fitment and finish.  In keeping with this IS 350's future track mission, Design Craft fabrication has installed a four-point roll bar with SPARCO five-point harness that keeps the driver secure in the SPARCO QRT-K Carbon/Kevlar race seats. For suspension, custom built KW Variant 3 coilovers help keep the vehicle controlled and planted while offering a range of height adjustability. The carbon-ceramic braking system from the Lexus RCF Track edition has been grafted on to this IS.  The car features two different wheelsets for the track and the street. The super lightweight track focused combination is the ADVAN Racing Beyond GT forged 19-inch wheels in Hyper Black Machine finish. The show wheels are 20"" Rotiform KPS models in Matte Copper. All wheels are covered in <span class=""xn-person"">Michelin Pilot Sport</span> 4s rubber.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <b>BUILD BOX DSPORT/SCOTT PRUETT TRACK PERFORMANCE IS 350 – PHASE ONE</b> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Exterior</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Complete Artisan Spirits fiberglass and carbon fiber weave body kit </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">FR Wide Fender (+30mm)</span> &nbsp; <span class=""prnews_span"">RR Over Fenders (+50mm)</span> &nbsp; <span class=""prnews_span"">Carbon Fiber Side Step</span> &nbsp; <span class=""prnews_span"">Carbon Fiber Front Splitter</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Rear Diffuser</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Carbon Fiber Wing w/Titanium Mounts</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Carbon Fiber Front</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Custom body wrap </b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Applied by Boss Wraps</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Troy Lee Designs inspired by Pruett Helmet art </span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Chassis</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Design Craft Fabrication Custom 4-point Roll Bar w/ integrated harness bar</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">1.75"" DOM tuning</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Suspension </b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">KW Variant 3 height-adjustable coil overs</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">-FR Independent Comp/Rebound Adjustment</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">-FR Higher-Rate Coilover Spring</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">-RR Independent Comp/Rebound Adjustment</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">-RR Higher-Rate Spring w/ Height Adjustment</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Brakes</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">RC F Track Edition Carbon Ceramic Braking System</span> &nbsp; <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Wheels/Tires</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Track Package:</span> &nbsp; <span class=""prnews_span"">ADVAN Racing Beyond GT Hyper Black Machine </span> &nbsp; <span class=""prnews_span"">19x9.5 +29 (F), 19x10.5 +15 (R)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Tires</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Michelin Pilot Sport 4S </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">275/35R19 (F), 305/30R19 (R)</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Show Package:</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Rotiform 20"" KPS, Matte Monaco Copper (Show)</span> &nbsp; <span class=""prnews_span"">Tires </span> <span class=""prnews_span"">Michelin Pilot Sport 4S 275/30R20 (F), 325/25R20 (R)</span> <span class=""prnews_span""><b>Interior</b></span> <span class=""prnews_span"">SPARCO QRT-K Carbon/Kevlar Race Seats</span> &nbsp; <span class=""prnews_span"">Design Craft Fab Power Seat Slider</span> <span class=""prnews_span"">SPARCO 5-point Racing Harnesses</span> Lexus' passion for brave design, imaginative technology, and exhilarating performance enables the luxury lifestyle brand to create amazing experiences for its guests.

Hence, sponsors aiming to conduct clinical studies that involve an IND should gain exemption from the FDA to permit the shipping of the investigational drug to clinical investigators in several states.<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr"">The pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy in 2020 and has an ongoing impact on various industries. However, the market for IND CDMO has benefited from the pandemic. Prior to COVID-19, prospective sponsors demanded facility audits to ensure CDMOs had the required capacity, equipment, and personnel to undertake their projects. Nowadays, CDMOs should find new ways to attract new sponsors, such as through videos, virtual reality, and other technologies that allow sponsors to virtually experience the site.<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr""><b>Investigational New Drug CDMO Market Report Highlights</b> <b>Key Topics Covered:</b> <br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr""><b>Chapter 1 Methodology and Scope</b><br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr""><b>Chapter 2 Executive Summary</b><br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr""><b>Chapter 3 Global IND CDMO Market: Variables, Trends, &amp; Scope</b><br class=""dnr"">3.1 Market Segmentation and Scope<br class=""dnr"">3.2 Market Dynamics<br class=""dnr"">3.2.1 Market Driver Analysis<br class=""dnr"">3.2.1.1 Increasing outsourcing services by pharmaceutical companies<br class=""dnr"">3.2.1.2 Rising investment in R&amp;D<br class=""dnr"">3.2.1.3 Growing pharmaceutical industry<br class=""dnr"">3.2.1.5 Stringent regulatory requirements<br class=""dnr"">3.2.2 Market Restraint Analysis<br class=""dnr"">3.2.2.1 Compliance issues while outsourcing<br class=""dnr"">3.2.2.2 Changing scenario in developing countries<br class=""dnr"">3.3 Penetration &amp; Growth Prospect Mapping<br class=""dnr"">3.4 COVID-19 Impact on the Market<br class=""dnr"">3.5 Major Deals and Strategic Alliances Analysis<br class=""dnr"">3.6 Global IND CDMO: Market Analysis Tools<br class=""dnr"">3.6.1 Industry Analysis - Porter's<br class=""dnr"">3.6.3 PESTEL Analysis<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr""><b>Chapter 4 Global IND CDMO Market: Product Segment Analysis</b><br class=""dnr"">4.1 Global IND CDMO Market: Product Market Share Analysis, 2020 &amp; 2028<br class=""dnr"">4.2 Small Molecule<br class=""dnr"">4.2.1 Small Molecule Market, 2016 - 2028 (USD Million)<br class=""dnr"">4.3 Large Molecule<br class=""dnr"">4.3.1 Large Molecule Market, 2016 - 2028 (USD Million)<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr""><b>Chapter 5 Global IND CDMO Market: Service Segment Analysis</b><br class=""dnr"">5.1 Global IND CDMO Market: Service Market Share Analysis, 2020 &amp; 2028<br class=""dnr"">5.2 Contract Development<br class=""dnr"">5.3 Contract Manufacturing<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr""><b>Chapter 6 Global IND CDMO Market: End-user Segment Analysis</b><br class=""dnr"">6.1 Global IND CDMO Market: End-user Market Share Analysis, 2020 &amp; 2028<br class=""dnr"">6.2 Pharmaceutical Companies<br class=""dnr"">6.2.1 Pharmaceutical companies IND CDMO Market, 2016 - 2028 (USD Million)<br class=""dnr"">6.3 Biotech<br class=""dnr"">6.3.2.

 News provided by Nov 02, 2021, 16:00 ET Share this article <b>Компания Winner Medical представит свои инновационные решения по уходу за ранами и предотвращению инфекций на выставке MEDICA-2021</b> <span>ШЭНЬЧЖЭНЬ (Китай)</span>, <span>2 ноября 2021 г.</span> /PRNewswire/ -- Компания Winner Medical (300888.SZ), один из ведущих производителей медицинских изделий, намеревается представить ряд инновационных решений по уходу за ранами, а также одноразовые изделия медицинского назначения для использования в операционной в ходе выставки MEDICA-2021, которая пройдет в Дюссельдорфе (Германия) с 15 по 18 ноября. В павильоне 6 на стенде A10 компания продемонстрирует свою продукцию для ухода за ранами и предотвращения инфекций. Ее новаторские разработки созданы для решения проблем, с которыми сталкивается медицинский персонал по всему миру, и призваны гарантировать оптимальный уход для защиты здоровья и благополучия пациентов. «Наше стремление обеспечить безопасность пациентов и медицинских работников делает компанию Winner Medical экспертом в области лечения ран и предотвращения распространения инфекций в операционных. При создании наших новаторских решений для проведения хирургических вмешательств и ухода за ранами мы использовали самые передовые технологии», — заявил генеральный директор компании Winner Medical Цзяньцюань Ли (<span class=""xn-person"">Jianquan Li</span>). «Качество продукции и социальная ответственность являются нашими главными приоритетами. Мы постоянно внедряем инновации и разрабатываем продукты следующего поколения для заживления ран и предотвращения распространения инфекций. При этом наша компания использует экологически чистое сырье, чтобы минимизировать воздействие на климат и окружающую среду», — добавил он. На выставке MEDICA-2021 компания Winner Medical представит ряд своих новейших разработок в области ухода за ранами, в основе которых лежат пять технологий: силикон, вспенивающиеся материалы, противомикробные средства, биотехнологии и гелеобразующие волокна. Они предназначены для предотвращения разрушения кожи, лечения сложных ран и защиты организма на протяжении всего цикла заживления. Продукция компании имеет сертификат Государственного управления по контролю за лекарственными средствами КНР (NMPA) и соответствует стандарту Conformité Européenne (CE) ЕС. Кроме того, она одобрена Министерством здравоохранения, труда и благосостояния Японии и Управлением по санитарному надзору за качеством пищевых продуктов и медикаментов США (FDA). Разработки Winner Medical широко используются медицинскими работниками более чем в 110 странах мира для лечения острых и хронических ран, вызванных диабетом, неподвижностью, заболеваниями вен, а также травматическими повреждениями, ожогами, инвазивными операциями и другими причинами. Основная линейка продукции компании для профилактики распространения инфекций включает в себя одежду для использования в операционной. Изделия выполнены из 100% хлопка спанлейс — биоразлагаемого дышащего материала, который защищает от намокания и проникновения бактерий. Легкий материал обеспечивает надежную защиту во время стандартных хирургических операций, предполагающих средний уровень загрязнения биологическими жидкостями и риск заражения. Хирургический халат PURCOTTON производства Winner Medical имеет дополнительную защиту на груди и рукавах и предназначен для проведения процедур, предполагающих высокий уровень загрязнения биологическими жидкостями. <b>Информация о компании Winner Medical</b> Компания Winner Medical Co., Ltd.

The dinner saw more than $3.1 million raised that will directly benefit the University's most deserving students. Held on <span class=""xn-chron"">Friday, October 29</span>, in the Grand Ballroom of the New York Hilton Midtown, this was the first in-person President's Dinner since 2019. Serving as the University's premier fundraising event of the year, the dinner saw more than <span class=""xn-money"">$3.1 million</span> raised—including over <span class=""xn-money"">$200,000</span> at the dinner itself—that will directly benefit the University's most deserving students. More than 600 preregistered and vaccinated guests attended the event. The ballroom, adorned in St. John's red and white, served as a backdrop for the first dinner hosted by Rev. <span class=""xn-person"">Brian J. Shanley</span>, O.P., President of <span class=""xn-location"">St. John's</span>. ""The fact that we're here tonight—having the time that we're having, in the world in which we're living—is a little bit of a miracle,"" he observed, clearly moved by the experience. ""And it's something that we cannot take for granted."" The event also honors those who best exemplify the University's Catholic and Vincentian mission, presenting them with the <i>Spirit of Service Award</i>. These select individuals serve as role models as they incorporate these values into their lives in a meaningful way. It is also a wonderful opportunity for current students to interact with the highest caliber of <span class=""xn-location"">St. John's</span> graduates: people who have risen to the top of their professions while never forgetting their humble roots. This year's honorees are all graduates of <span class=""xn-org"">St. John's University</span>:  <span class=""xn-person"">Thomas J.

""As a <span class=""xn-location"">St. John's</span> community, we need to lift up the grace-filled good that is in our midst and that is in the people who are here.

Doodle Labs is powered by the generative minting technology from the cutting edge and wildly successful Art Blocks platform. Doodle Labs allows artists to create collections of one-of-one-of-X NFTs that are immutably stored on the blockchain. ""Doodle Labs is excited to bring the vision of artists and brands to life via algorithmic generative on-chain art,"" says Matthew Dweck,&nbsp; Founder of Doodle Labs. ""We're just getting started here."" ""NFTs feel like a key to open up a door to creativity on another level,"" Mr. Kaves says. ""The digital age is here and it gives artists a new way to create. This is a platform for artists to really flex their skills on multiple levels."" Coming to life of a pizzeria napkin and featured in an issue of Mass Appeal Magazine two decades ago, Mr. Kaves envisioned The Family Mooks as a TV show. But after it got caught up in red tape, he got frustrated and put the project down. Eliminating that red tape, through direct to fanbase engagement and sales, that's the power of NFTs and what made Mr. Kaves bring The Family Mooks back to life. ""For artists to have a new platform where they can be in direct contact with the collector is amazing. It's a way to cut out the gatekeepers,"" Mr. Kaves says. ""It's pretty incredible that such a small community, such as the NFT community, has so much power."" The Family Mooks sold 3,951 unique NFTs —&nbsp;2,206 were sold via a presale and the other 1,745 were sold via a Dutch Auction in a public drop. Dweck goes on to say, ""When I walked into Mr. Kaves studio and saw his original paintings from 20 years ago of The Family Mooks, I knew we had something very special."" More drops for The Family Mooks project are forthcoming, but Mr. Kaves says, the main goal is to figure out how to tell a compelling, immersive story.

Although it's never easy for a founder to step back, it was the next right decision for her to explore her creativity outside of the daily demands of running an agency. Below please find the announcement in her own words. </i> After 16 years of growing and running Tattoo Projects, I am excited to announce that I've stepped away from my agency role, and have entrusted the company to new leadership. I will remain as Founder and will be involved on select creative and strategy projects as appropriate. The past two years have been a time of challenges and transitions, for the agency, with the death of my original business partner Rudy, to the ways the world has changed. Since then, with the incredible support of my business partner <span class=""xn-person"">Scott Smith</span> and President <span class=""xn-person"">Chad Brophy</span>, so much has been accomplished. I am especially proud of my work redefining the agency brand, restructuring departments, streamlining processes and hand selecting key hires, as well as my close involvement in the design of the new building/studio. With all of this in place, and with its new creative home, Tattoo Projects has never been better positioned for long term success. This time has also given me the opportunity to reflect on what is most authentic and rewarding to me, which is being a Creative. I'm shifting my energy to align with my personal mission of channeling my creative and business talents into cultivating more meaningful, joyful, vibrant work with the intention of elevating and supporting others, most especially working women. &nbsp; I'm incredibly grateful for the people and opportunities that have come since founding Tattoo Projects and can't wait for what the future will bring.&nbsp; Please direct any questions to <a href=""mailto:hello@tattooprojects.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hello@tattooprojects.com</a>  SOURCE Tattoo Projects <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>

Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Alternative investment funds, ETFs, interval funds, and closed–end funds are subject to management and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. Debt instruments are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk and may be subordinated to more senior debt instruments. BDCs often use leverage to enhance returns and are subject to interest rate risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. CLOs are debt instruments but also carry additional risks related to the complexity and leverage inherent in the CLO structure. The use of leverage, such as borrowing money to purchase securities, will cause the Fund to incur additional expenses and magnify the Fund's gains or losses.</b>&nbsp; <i>There currently is no secondary market for the Fund's shares and the Fund expects that no secondary market will develop. Shares of the Fund will not be listed on any securities exchange, which makes them inherently illiquid. An investment in the Fund's shares is not suitable for investors who cannot tolerate risk of loss or who require liquidity, other than the liquidity provided through the Fund's repurchase policy. Limited liquidity is provided to shareholders only through the Fund's quarterly repurchase offers, regardless of how the Fund performs. The Fund's distributions policy may, under certain circumstances, have certain adverse consequences to the Fund and its shareholders because it may result in a return of capital, resulting in less of a shareholder's assets being invested in the Fund, and, over time, increase the Fund's expense ratio. Any invested capital that is returned to the shareholder will be reduced by the Fund's fees and expenses, as well as the applicable sales load. Investments in lesser–known, small and medium capitalization companies may be more vulnerable than larger, more established organizations. The sales of securities to fund repurchases could reduce the market price of those securities, which in turn would reduce the Fund's NAV. </i> <b>About the Advisor <br class=""dnr""></b><span class=""xn-person"">Sierra Crest</span> is an affiliate of BC Partners Advisors L.P.

The market is then expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.3% from 2025 and reach <span class=""xn-money"">$211,909.7 million</span> in 2030. Growth in the historic period resulted from a rise in foreign direct investments, emerging markets growth, growth in media development, and technology developments.<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr"">Factors that negatively affected growth in the historic period were lack of resources, reductions in free trade, and increasing inventory levels. Going forward, increasing adoption of trendy clothes by the growing youth population, increasing penetration of social media, growing demand for sportswear and performance wear, and low-cost production will drive the growth. Factors that could hinder the growth of the fast fashion market in the future include increasing transparency of poor working conditions, negative environmental impact, counterfeit products, limited cotton production, and the impact of COVID-19.<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr"">The fast fashion market is segmented by gender into males and females clothing.

The fast fashion market size will gain the most in <span class=""xn-location"">China</span> at <span class=""xn-money"">$17,401.8 million</span>.<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr"">Market-trend-based strategies for the fast fashion market include using virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR), use of blockchain technology in the market, artificial intelligence in designing clothing, using the internet of things (IoT), new ownership models, 3D printing, and increased demand for manmade fibers.<br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr"">To take advantage of the opportunities, the report recommends the fast fashion companies to enhance their business presence in the e-commerce sector through investments and initiatives taken towards the development of advanced technological solutions to integrate physical stores and the online marketplace or platform, focus on the development and launch of webstores to increase the accessibility and convenience towards the customer, focus on expanding its business and operational presence through strategic agreements and plans to expand and establish stores and manufacturing facilities in developing regions, and companies can also focus on growth via strategic acquisitions. <b>Report Highlights</b><br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr""><b>Fast Fashion Market Trends And Strategies</b> <b>Impact Of COVID-19 On The Fast Fashion Market</b> <b>Companies Mentioned</b> For more information about this report visit <a href=""https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5459425/fast-fashion-global-market-opportunities-and?utm_source=CI&amp;utm_medium=PressRelease&amp;utm_code=3smtx7&amp;utm_campaign=1611749+-+Global+Fast+Fashion+Market+Report+2021+-+Market+is+Expected+to+Grow+at+a+CAGR+of+5.3%25+from+2025+and+Reach+%24211%2c909.7+Million+in+2030&amp;utm_exec=chdo54prd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/pj73o5</a> <b>Media Contact:</b> Research and Markets <br class=""dnr""><span class=""xn-person"">Laura Wood</span>, Senior Manager <br class=""dnr""><a href=""mailto:press@researchandmarkets.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">press@researchandmarkets.com</a> <br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr"">For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470 <br class=""dnr"">For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630 <br class=""dnr"">For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 <br class=""dnr""><br class=""dnr"">U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907 <br class=""dnr"">Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716 SOURCE Research and Markets  <a title=""Link to http://www.researchandmarkets.com"" href=""http://www.researchandmarkets.com/"" class=""linkOnClick"" data-include="""" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.researchandmarkets.com</a><br> More news releases in similar topics <a href=""tel:Cision%20Distribution%20888-776-0942"">Cision Distribution 888-776-0942</a><br>
